<p>When I was actually experiencing the thrill, it came
delightfully, however, blended with a threat that proclaimed the
imminent consequence of dismay. I appreciated the coming of the
thrill, as a rare and unexpected &ldquo;dramatic moment.&rdquo; I
savoured and enjoyed it as a real adventure suddenly presented in
the midst of the common business of life. I imaginatively
transplanted the scene from the Hall of Thorp-Jervaise to a
West-End theatre; and in my instant part of unoccupied spectator I
admired the art with which the affair had been staged. It is so
seldom that we are given an opportunity to witness one of these
&ldquo;high moments,&rdquo; and naturally enough I began
instinctively to turn the scene into literature; admitting without
hesitation, as I am often forced to admit, that the detail of
reality is so much better and more typical than any I can
invent.</p>
<p>But, having said that, I wonder how far one does invent in such
an experience? The same night I hinted something of my appreciation
of the dramatic quality of the stir at the Hall door to Frank
Jervaise, Brenda&rsquo;s brother, and he, quite obviously, had
altogether missed that aspect of the affair. He scowled with that
forensic, bullying air he is so successfully practising at the
Junior Bar, as he said, &ldquo;I suppose you realise just what this
may <em>mean</em>, to all of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jervaise evidently had failed to appreciate the detail that I
had relished with such delight. He had certainly not savoured the
quality of it. And in one sense I may claim to have invented the
business of the scene. I may have added to it by my imaginative
participation. In any case my understanding as interpreter was the
prime essential&mdash;a fact that shows how absurd it is to speak
of &ldquo;photographic detail&rdquo; in literature, or indeed to
attempt a proper differentiation between realism and romance.</p>
<p>We were all of us in the Hall, an inattentive, chattering
audience of between twenty and thirty people. The last dance had
been stopped at ten minutes to twelve, in order that the local
parson and his wife&mdash;their name was Sturton&mdash;might be out
of the house of entertainment before the first stroke of Sunday
morning. Every one was wound up to a pitch of satisfied excitement.
The Cinderella had been a success. The floor and the music and the
supper had been good, Mrs. Jervaise had thrown off her air of
pre-occupation with some distasteful suspicion, and we had all been
entertained and happy. And yet these causes for satisfaction had
been nothing more than a setting for Brenda Jervaise. It was she
who had stimulated us, given us a lead and kept us dancing to the
tune of her exciting personality. She had made all the difference
between an ordinarily successful dance and what Mrs. Sturton at the
open door continually described as &ldquo;a really delightful
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had to repeat the phrase, because with the first stroke of
midnight ringing out from the big clock over the stables, came also
the first intimation of the new movement. Mrs. Sturton&rsquo;s fly
was mysteriously delayed; and I had a premonition even then, that
the delay promised some diversion. The tone of the stable clock had
its influence, perhaps. It was so precisely the tone of a stage
clock&mdash;high and pretentious, and with a disturbing suggestion
of being unmelodiously flawed.</p>
<p>Miss Tattersall, Olive Jervaise&rsquo;s friend, a rather
abundant fair young woman, warmed by excitement to the realisation
that she must flirt with some one, also noticed the theatrical
sound of that announcement of midnight. She giggled a little
nervously as stroke succeeded stroke in an apparently unending
succession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems as if it were going on all night,&rdquo; she
said to me, in a self-conscious voice, as if the sound of the bell
had some emotional effect upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s out of place,&rdquo; I said
for the sake of saying something; &ldquo;theatrical and artificial,
you know. It ought to be&hellip;&rdquo; I did not know quite what
it ought to be and stopped in the middle of the sentence. I was
aware of the wide open door, of the darkness beyond, and of the
timid visiting of the brilliant, chattering crowd by the fragrance
of scented night-stock&mdash;a delicate, wayward incursion that
drifted past me like the spirit of some sweet, shabby fairy. What
possible bell could be appropriate to that air? I began, stupidly,
to recall the names of such flowers as bluebell, hare-bell,
Canterbury-bell. In imagination I heard their chime as the distant
tinkling of a fairy musical-box.</p>
<p>Miss Tattersall, however, took no notice of my failure to find
the ideal. &ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said, and then
the horrible striking ceased, and we heard little Nora Bailey
across the Hall excitedly claiming that the clock had struck
thirteen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I counted most carefully,&rdquo; she was insisting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why that man doesn&rsquo;t
come,&rdquo; Mrs. Sturton repeated in a raised voice, as if she
wanted to still the superstitious qualms that Miss Bailey had
started. &ldquo;I told him to come round at a quarter to twelve, so
that there shouldn&rsquo;t be any mistake. It&rsquo;s very
tiresome.&rdquo; She paused on that and Jervaise was inspired to
the statement that the fly came from the Royal Oak, didn&rsquo;t
it, a fact that Mrs. Sturton had already affirmed more than
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes it rather embarrassing for the dear
Jervaises,&rdquo; Miss Tattersall confided to me, &ldquo;is that
the other things aren&rsquo;t ordered till one&mdash;the
Atkinsons&rsquo; &rsquo;bus, you know, and the rest of &rsquo;em.
Brenda persuaded Mrs. Jervaise that we might go on for a bit after
the vicar had gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wished that I could get away from Miss Tattersall; she
intruded on my thoughts. I was trying to listen to a little piece
that was unfolding in my mind, a piece that began with the coming
of the spirit of the night-stock into this material atmosphere of
heated, excited men and women. I realised that invasion as the
first effort of the wild romantic night to enter the house; after
that&hellip;. After that I only knew that the consequences were
intensely interesting and that if I could but let my thoughts guide
me, they would finish the story and make it exquisite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! did she?&rdquo; I commented automatically, and cursed
myself for having conveyed a warmth of interest I certainly did not
feel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s so enthusiastic, isn&rsquo;t she? Brenda, I
mean,&rdquo; Miss Tattersall went on, and as I listened I compared
her to the stable-clock. She, too, was a persistent outrage, a
hindrance to whatever it was that I was waiting for.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sturton and her husband were coming back, with an
appearance of unwillingness, into the warmth and light of the Hall.
The dear lady was still at her congratulations on the
delightfulness of the evening, but they were tempered, now, by a
hint of apology for &ldquo;spoiling it&mdash;to a certain
extent&mdash;I hope I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;by this unfortunate
contretemps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jervaises were uncomfortably warm in their reassurances.
They felt, no doubt, the growing impatience of all their other
visitors pressing forward with the reminder that if the
Sturtons&rsquo; cab did not come at once, there would be no more
dancing.</p>
<p>Half-way up the stairs little Nora Bailey&rsquo;s high laughing
voice was embroidering her statement with regard to the extra
stroke of the stable-clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a kind of premonition that it was going to, as soon
as it began,&rdquo; she was saying.</p>
<p>Gordon Hughes was telling the old story of the sentry who had
saved his life by a similar counting of the strokes of
midnight.</p>
<p>And at the back of my mind my d&aelig;mon was still thrusting
out little spurts of enthralling allegory. The Sturtons and
Jervaises had been driven in from the open. They were taking refuge
in their house. Presently&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given it up?&rdquo; I remarked with stupid politeness to
Miss Tattersall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve sent John round to the stables to
inquire,&rdquo; she told me.</p>
<p>I do not know how she knew. &ldquo;John&rdquo; was the only
man-servant that the Jervaises employed in the house; butler,
footman, valet and goodness knows what else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Sturton seems to be afraid of the night-air,&rdquo;
Miss Tattersall remarked with a complacent giggle of
self-congratulation on being too modern for such prejudices.
&ldquo;I simply love the night-air, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she
continued. &ldquo;I often go out for a stroll in the garden the
last thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I guessed her intention, but I was not going to compromise
myself by strolling about the Jervaise domain at midnight with
Grace Tattersall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you? Yes,&rdquo; I agreed, as if I were bound to
admire her originality.</p>
<p>They are afraid of the night-air, my allegory went on, and
having begun their retreat, they are now sending out their servant
for help. I began to wonder if I were composing the plot of a grand
opera?</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s return convinced me that I was not to be
disappointed in my expectation of drama.</p>
<p>He came out from under the staircase through the red baize door
which discreetly warned the stranger that beyond this danger signal
lay the sacred mysteries of the Hall&rsquo;s service. And he came
down to the central cluster of faintly irritated Sturtons and
Jervaises, with an evident hesitation that marked the gravity of
his message. Every one was watching that group under the
electric-lighted chandelier&mdash;it was posed to hold the
stage&mdash;but I fancy that most of the audience were solely
interested in getting rid of the unhappy Sturtons.</p>
<p>We could not hear what John said, but we inferred the general
nature of the disaster from the response accorded to his news. The
vicar merely clicked his tongue with a frown of grave disapproval,
but his wife advertised the disaster for us by saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that man Carter, from the Oak, you know; not
our own man. I&rsquo;ve never liked Carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite hopelessly, eh?&rdquo; Jervaise asked John, and
John&rsquo;s perturbed shake of the head answered that question
beyond any doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; Mrs. Sturton began, and I hazarded a
guess that she was going to refuse to drive behind Carter in any
stage of intoxication; but she decided to abandon that line and
went on with a splendid imitation of cheerfulness, &ldquo;However,
there&rsquo;s nothing to be done, now, but walk. It&rsquo;s quite a
fine night, fortunately.&rdquo; She looked at her husband for
approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! quite, quite,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A beautiful
night. Let us walk by all means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A general rustle of relief spread up the gallery of the
staircase, and was followed at once by a fresh outburst of chatter.
The waiting audience of would-be dancers had responded like one
individual. It was as if their single over-soul had sighed its
thankfulness and had then tried to cover the solecism. Their relief
was short-lived. Mrs. Jervaise &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t think&rdquo;
of the Sturtons walking. They must have the motor. She insisted.
Really nothing at all. Their chauffeur was sure to be up,
still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, certainly, by all means,&rdquo; Jervaise
agreed warmly, and then, to John, &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t gone to
bed yet, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him not half an hour ago, sir,&rdquo; was
John&rsquo;s response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him to bring the motor round,&rdquo; Jervaise
ordered, and added something in a lower voice, which, near as I was
to them, I could not catch. I imagined that it might be an
instruction to have the chauffeur out again if he had by any chance
slunk off to bed within the last half-hour.</p>
<p>I think Miss Tattersall said &ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; Certainly the
over-soul of the staircase group thought it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be here all night, at this rate,&rdquo; was
my companion&rsquo;s translation of the general feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they have to wake up the chauffeur,&rdquo; I
admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a new man they&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo; Miss
Tattersall replied. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve only had him three
months&hellip;&rdquo; It seemed as if she were about to add some
further comment, but nothing came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; was all that I found appropriate.</p>
<p>I felt that the action of my opera was hanging fire. Indeed,
every one was beginning to feel it. The Hall door had been shut
against the bane of the night-air. The stimulus of the fragrant
night-stock had been excluded. Miss Tattersall pretended not to
yawn. We all pretended that we did not feel a craving to yawn. The
chatter rose and fell spasmodically in short devitalised bursts of
polite effort.</p>
<p>I looked round for Brenda, but could not see her anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come back into the drawing-room?&rdquo;
Mrs. Jervaise was saying to the Sturtons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! thank you, it&rsquo;s <em>hardly</em> worth while, is
it?&rdquo; Mrs. Sturton answered effusively, but she loosened the
shawl that muffled her throat as if she were preparing for a longer
wait. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <em>so</em> sorry,&rdquo; she apologised for
the seventh time. &ldquo;So very unfortunate after such a really
delightful evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They kept up that kind of conversation for quite a long time,
while we listened eagerly for the sound of the motor-horn.</p>
<p>And no motor-horn came; instead, after endlessly tedious
minutes, John returned bearing himself like a portent of
disaster.</p>
<p>The confounded fellow whispered again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, not anywhere?&rdquo; Jervaise asked irritably.
&ldquo;Sure he hasn&rsquo;t gone to bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John said something in that too discreet voice of his, and then
Jervaise scowled and looked round at the ascending humanity of the
staircase. His son Frank detached himself from the swarm, politely
picked his way down into the Hall, and began to put John under a
severe cross-examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now, do you suppose?&rdquo; Miss
Tattersall asked, with the least tremor of excitement sounding in
her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the chauffeur has followed the example of Carter,
and afterwards hidden his shame,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>I was surprised by the warmth of her contradiction. &ldquo;Oh,
no&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t the least that sort of
man.&rdquo; She said it as if I had aspersed the character of one
of her friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to have gone, disappeared, any-way,&rdquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting frightfully mysterious,&rdquo; Miss
Tattersall agreed, and added inconsequently, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got
a strong face, you know; keen&mdash;looks as if he&rsquo;d get his
own way about things, though, of course, he isn&rsquo;t a
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had a suspicion that she had been flirting with the romantic
chauffeur. She was the sort of young woman who would flirt with any
one.</p>
<p>I wished they would open that Hall door again. The action of my
play had become dispersed and confused. Frank Jervaise had gone off
through the baize door with John, and the Sturtons and their host
and hostess were moving reluctantly towards the drawing-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might almost as well go and sit down somewhere,&rdquo;
I suggested to Miss Tattersall, and noted three or four accessible
blanks on the staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost,&rdquo; she agreed after a glance at the closed
door that shut out the night.</p>
<p>In the re-arrangement I managed to leave her on a lower step,
and climbed to the throne of the gods, at present occupied only by
Gordon Hughes, one of Frank Jervaise&rsquo;s barrister friends from
the Temple. Hughes was reputed &ldquo;brilliantly clever.&rdquo; He
was a tallish fellow with ginger red hair and a long nose&mdash;the
foxy type.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rum start!&rdquo; I cried, by way of testing his
intellectual quality, but before I could get on terms with him, the
stage was taken by a dark, curly-haired, handsome boy of
twenty-four or so, generally addressed as &ldquo;Ronnie.&rdquo; I
had thought him very like a well-intentioned retriever pup. I could
imagine him worrying an intellectual slipper to pieces with great
gusto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, it&rsquo;s all U.P. now,&rdquo; he said, in a
dominating voice. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the time?&rdquo; He was
obviously too well turned out to wear a watch with evening
dress.</p>
<p>Some one said it was &ldquo;twenty-five to one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty to one against another dance, then,&rdquo; Ronnie
barked joyously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;ll offer yourself up as a martyr in a
good cause,&rdquo; suggested Nora Bailey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Offer myself up? How?&rdquo; Ronnie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take &rsquo;em home in your car,&rdquo; Nora said in a
penetrating whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead the other way,&rdquo; was Ronnie&rsquo;s too patent
excuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a couple of miles through the Park, you
know,&rdquo; Olive Jervaise put in. &ldquo;You might easily run
them over to the vicarage and be back again in twenty
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove; yes. So I might,&rdquo; Ronnie acknowledged.
&ldquo;That is, if I may really come back, Miss Jervaise. Awfully
good of you to suggest it. I didn&rsquo;t bring my man with me,
though. I&rsquo;ll have to go and wind up the old buzz-wagon
myself, if your fellow can&rsquo;t be found. Do you think &hellip;
could any one&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was looking round, searching for some one who was not
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want any help?&rdquo; Hughes asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks. That&rsquo;s all right. I know where the car
is, I mean,&rdquo; Ronnie said, and still hesitated as if he were
going to finish the question he had begun in his previous
speech.</p>
<p>Olive Jervaise anticipated, I think wrongly, his remark.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re in the drawing-room,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Will you tell them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get the car round first, hadn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
Ronnie asked.</p>
<p>The sandy Atkinson youth found an answer for that. He cleared
his long, thin throat huskily and said, &ldquo;Might save time to
tell &rsquo;em first. They&rsquo;d be ready, then, when you came
round.&rdquo; His two equally sandy sisters clucked their
approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All serene,&rdquo; Ronnie agreed.</p>
<p>He was on the bottom step of the stairs when the Hall door was
thrown wide open and Frank Jervaise returned.</p>
<p>He stood there a moment, posed for us, searching the ladder of
our gallery; and the spirit of the night-stock drifted past him and
lightly touched us all as it fled up the stairs. Then he came
across the Hall, and addressing his sister, asked, in a voice that
overstressed the effect of being casual, &ldquo;I say, Olive, you
don&rsquo;t happen to know where Brenda is, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suppose our over-soul knew everything in that minute. A tremor
of dismay ran up our ranks like the sudden passing of a cold wind.
Every one was looking at Ronnie.</p>
<p>Olive Jervaise&rsquo;s reply furnished an almost superfluous
corroboration. She could not control her voice. She tried to be as
casual as her brother, and failed lamentably. &ldquo;Brenda was
here just now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She&mdash;she must be
somewhere about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ronnie, still the cynosure of the swarm, turned himself about
and stared at Frank Jervaise. But it was Gordon Hughes who
demonstrated his power of quick inference and response, although in
doing it he overstepped the bounds of decency by giving a voice to
our suspicions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the car in the garage? Your own car?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Rather. Of course,&rdquo; Jervaise replied
uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just looked?&rdquo; Hughes insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the car&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; was Jervaise&rsquo;s
huffy evasion, and he took Ronnie by the arm and led him off into
the drawing-room.</p>
<p>The Hall door stood wide open, and the tragedy of the night
flowed unimpeded through the house.</p>
<p>Although the horror had not been named we all recognised its
finality. We began to break up our formation immediately, gabbling
tactful irrelevancies about the delightful evening, the delinquent
Carter, and the foolishness of Sabbatarianism. Mrs. Atkinson
appeared in the Hall, cloaked and muffled, and beckoned to her
three replicas. She announced that their omnibus was &ldquo;just
coming round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the general downward drift of dispersion I saw Grace
Tattersall looking up at me with an expression that suggested a
desire for the confidential discussion of scandal, and I hastily
whispered to Hughes that we might go to the extemporised buffet in
the supper-room and get a whisky and seltzer or something. He
agreed with an alacrity that I welcomed at the time, but regret,
now, because our retirement into duologue took us out of the
important movement, and I missed one or two essentials of the
development.</p>
<p>The truth is that we were all overcome at the moment by an
irresistible desire to appear tactful. We wanted to show the
Jervaises that we had not suspected anything, or that if we had, we
didn&rsquo;t mind in the least, and it certainly wasn&rsquo;t their
fault. Nevertheless, I saw no reason why in the privacy of the
supper-room&mdash;we had the place to ourselves&mdash;I should not
talk to Hughes. I had never before that afternoon met any of the
Jervaise family except Frank, and on one or two occasions his
younger brother who was in the army and, now, in India; and I
thought that this was an appropriate occasion to improve my
knowledge. I understood that Hughes was an old friend of the
family.</p>
<p>He may have been, although the fact did not appear in his
conversation; for I discovered almost immediately that he was,
either by nature or by reason of his legal training, cursed with a
procrastinating gift of diplomacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awkward affair!&rdquo; I began as soon as we had got our
whiskies and lighted cigarettes.</p>
<p>Hughes drank with a careful slowness, put his glass down with
superfluous accuracy, and then after another instant of tremendous
deliberation, said, &ldquo;What is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this,&rdquo; I returned gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo; he asked judicially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it may be too soon to draw an inference,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially with no facts to draw them from,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; I went on boldly, &ldquo;it looks
horribly suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I began to lose patience with him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
suggesting that the Sturtons&rsquo; man from the Royal Oak has been
murdered,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>He weighed that remark as if it might cover a snare, before he
scored a triumph of allusiveness by replying, &ldquo;Fellow called
Carter. He&rsquo;s got a blue nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite my exasperation I tried once more on a note of forced
geniality, &ldquo;What sort of man is this chauffeur of the
Jervaises? Do you know him at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wears brown leather gaiters,&rdquo; Hughes answered after
another solemn deliberation.</p>
<p>I could have kicked him with all the pleasure in life. His awful
guardedness made me feel as if I were an inquisitive little
journalist trying to ferret out some unsavoury scandal. And he had
been the first person to point the general suspicion a few minutes
earlier, by his inquiry about the motor. I decided to turn the
tables on him, if I could manage it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked because you seemed to suggest just now that he
had gone off with the Jervaises&rsquo; motor,&rdquo; I
remarked.</p>
<p>Hughes stroked his long thin nose with his thumb and forefinger.
It seemed to take him about a minute from bridge to nostril. Then
he inhaled a long draught of smoke from his cigarette, closed one
eye as if it hurt him, and threw back his head to blow out the
smoke again with a slow gasp of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One never knows,&rdquo; was all the explanation he
vouchsafed after this tedious performance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether a chauffeur will steal his master&rsquo;s
motor?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incidentally,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, good heavens, if he&rsquo;s that sort of
man&hellip;&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying that he is,&rdquo; Hughes
replied.</p>
<p>I realised then that his idea of our conversation was nothing
more nor less than that of a game to be played as expertly as
possible. He had all the makings of a cabinet minister, but as a
companion he was, on this occasion, merely annoying. I felt that I
could stand no more of him, and I was trying to frame a sentence
that would convey my opinion of him without actual insult, when
Frank Jervaise looked in at the door.</p>
<p>He stared at us suspiciously, but his expression commonly
conveyed some aspect of threat or suspicion. &ldquo;Been looking
all over the place for you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; Hughes asked.</p>
<p>Jervaise shook his head. &ldquo;No, I want Melhuish,&rdquo; he
said, and stood scowling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here I am,&rdquo; I prompted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m in the way&hellip;&rdquo; Hughes put in, but
did not attempt to get himself out of it.</p>
<p>Jervaise ignored him. &ldquo;Look here, Melhuish,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I wonder if you&rsquo;d mind coming up with me to the
Home Farm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! no; rather not,&rdquo; I agreed gladly.</p>
<p>I felt that Hughes had been scored off; but I instantly forgot
such small triumphs in the delight of being able to get out into
the night. Out there was romance and the smell of night-stock, all
kinds of wonderment and adventure. I was so eager to be in the
midst of it that I never paused to consider the queerness of the
expedition.</p>
<p>As we left the Hall, the theatrical stable-clock was just
striking one.</p>

Contents</a></p>
<p>The moon must have been nearly at the full, but I could not
guess its position behind the even murk of cloud that muffled the
whole face of the sky. Yet, it was not very dark. The broad masses
of the garden through which Jervaise led me, were visible as a
greater blackness superimposed on a fainter background. I believed
that we were passing through some kind of formal pleasance. I could
smell the pseudo-aromatic, slightly dirty odour of box, and made
out here and there the clipped artificialities of a yew hedge.
There were standard roses, too. One rose started up suddenly before
my face, touching me as I passed with a limp, cool caress, like the
careless, indifferent encouragement of a preoccupied courtesan.</p>
<p>At the end of the pleasance we came to a high wall, and as
Jervaise fumbled with the fastening of a, to me, invisible door, I
was expecting that now we should come out into the open, into a
paddock, perhaps, or a grass road through the Park. But beyond the
wall was a kitchen garden. It was lighter there, and I could see
dimly that we were passing down an aisle of old espaliers that
stretched sturdy, rigid arms, locked finger to finger with each
other in their solemn grotesque guardianship of the enciente they
enclosed. No doubt in front of them was some kind of herbaceous
border. I caught sight of the occasional spire of a hollyhock, and
smelt the acid insurgence of marigolds.</p>
<p>None of this was at all the mischievous, taunting fairyland that
I had anticipated, but rather the gaunt, intimidating home of
ogres, rank and more than a trifle forbidding. It had an air of age
that was not immortal, but stiffly declining into a stubborn
resistance against the slow rigidity of death. These espaliers made
me think of rheumatic veterans, obstinately faithful to ancient
duties&mdash;veterans with knobbly arthritic joints.</p>
<p>At the end of the aisle we came to a high-arched opening in the
ten-foot wall, barred by a pair of heavy iron gates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute, I&rsquo;ve got the key,&rdquo; Jervaise
said. This was the first time he had spoken since we left the
house. His tone seemed to suggest that he was afraid I should
attempt to scale the wall or force my way through the bars of the
gates.</p>
<p>He had the key but he could not in that darkness fit it into the
padlock; and he asked me if I had any matches. I had a little
silver box of wax vestas in my pocket, and struck one to help him
in his search for the keyhole which he found to have been covered
by the escutcheon. Before I threw the match away I held it up and
glanced back across the garden. The shadows leaped and stiffened to
attention, and I flung the match away, but it did not go out. It
lay there on the path throwing out its tiny challenge to the
darkness. It was still burning when I looked back after passing
through the iron gates.</p>
<p>As we came out of the park, Jervaise took my arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid this is a pretty rotten business,&rdquo;
he said with what was for him an unusual cordiality.</p>
<hr />
<p>Although I had never before that afternoon seen Jervaise&rsquo;s
home nor any of his people with the exception of the brother now in
India, I had known Frank Jervaise for fifteen years. We had been at
Oakstone together, and had gone up the school form by form in each
other&rsquo;s company. After we left Oakstone we were on the same
landing at Jesus, and he rowed &ldquo;two&rdquo; and I rowed
&ldquo;bow&rdquo; in the college boat. And since we had come down I
had met him constantly in London, often as it seemed by accident.
Yet we had never been friends. I had never really liked him.</p>
<p>Even at school he had had the beginning of the artificially
bullying manner which now seemed natural to him. He had been
unconvincingly blunt and insolent. His dominant chin, Roman nose,
and black eyebrows were chiefly responsible, I think, for his
assumption of arrogance. He must have been newly invigorated to
carry on the part every time he scowled at himself in the glass. He
could not conceivably have been anything but a barrister.</p>
<p>But, to-night, in the darkness, he seemed to have forgotten for
once the perpetual mandate of his facial angle. He was suddenly
intimate, almost humble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you don&rsquo;t realise how cursedly awkward
it all is,&rdquo; he said with the evident desire of opening a
confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me as little or as much as you like,&rdquo; I
responded. &ldquo;You know that I&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, rather,&rdquo; he agreed warmly, and added,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner Hughes didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He guesses a lot, though,&rdquo; I put in. &ldquo;I
suppose they all do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, they&rsquo;re bound to guess something,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m hoping we&rsquo;ll be able to put
that right, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are we going to see?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He did not reply at once, and then snapped out, &ldquo;Anne
Banks; friend er Brenda&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My foolishly whimsical imagination translated that queer medley
of sounds into the thought of a stable-pump. I heard the clank of
the handle and then the musical rush of water into the pail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds just like a pump,&rdquo; I said thoughtlessly.</p>
<p>He half withdrew his arm from mine with an abrupt twitch that
indicated temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t for God&rsquo;s sake play the
fool,&rdquo; he said brutally.</p>
<p>A spasm of resentment shook me for a moment. I felt annoyed,
remembering how at school he would await his opportunity and then
score off me with some insulting criticism. He had never had any
kind of sympathy for the whimsical, and it is a manner that is apt
to look inane and ridiculous under certain kinds of censure. I
swallowed my annoyance, on this occasion. I remembered that
Jervaise had a reasonable excuse, for once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to play
the fool. But you must admit that it had a queer sound.&rdquo; I
repeated the adjectival sentence under my breath. It really was a
rather remarkable piece of onomatop&oelig;ia. And then I reflected
on the absurdity of our conversation. How could we achieve all this
ordinary trivial talk of everyday in the gloom of this romantic
adventure?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! all serene,&rdquo; Jervaise returned, still with the
sound of irritation in his voice, and continued as if the need for
confidence had suddenly overborne his anger. &ldquo;As a matter of
fact she&rsquo;s his sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose sister?&rdquo; I asked, quite at a loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Banks&rsquo;s, of course,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who in the name of goodness is Banks?&rdquo; I
inquired irritably. The petulant tone was merely an artifice. I
realised that if I were meek, he would lose more time in abusing my
apparent imbecility. I know that the one way to beat a bully is by
bullying, but I hate even the pretence of that method.</p>
<p>Jervaise grunted as if the endeavour to lift the weight of my
ignorance required an almost intolerable physical effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this fellow&mdash;our chauffeur,&rdquo; he said in a
voice so threateningly restrained that he seemed on the point of
bursting.</p>
<p>There was no help for it; I had to take the upper hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my good idiot,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you
can&rsquo;t expect me to know these things by intuition. I&rsquo;ve
never heard of the confounded fellow before. Haven&rsquo;t even
seen him, now. Nor his sister&mdash;Anne Banks,
Frienderbrenda&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jervaise was calmed by this outburst. This was the sort of
attitude he could understand and appreciate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, keep your shirt on,&rdquo; he replied quite
amicably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d condescend to explain,&rdquo; I returned
as huffily as I could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, this chap, Banks,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;isn&rsquo;t quite the ordinary chauffeur Johnnie. He&rsquo;s
the son of one of our farmers. Decent enough old fellow, too, in
his way&mdash;the father, I mean. Family&rsquo;s been tenants of
the Home Farm for centuries. And this chap, Banks, the son, has
knocked about the world, no end. Been in Canada and the States and
all kinds of weird places. He&rsquo;s hard as nails; and keen. His
mother was a Frenchwoman; been a governess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she dead?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, no. Why should she be?&rdquo; Jervaise replied
peevishly.</p>
<p>I thought of explaining that he had made the implication by his
use of the past tense, but gave up the idea as involving a waste of
energy. &ldquo;How old is this chap, Banks; the son?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Jervaise said. &ldquo;About
twenty-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his sister?&rdquo; I prodded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather younger than that,&rdquo; he said, after an
evident hesitation, and added: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s frightfully
pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I checked my natural desire to comment on the paradox; and tried
the stimulation of an interested &ldquo;<em>Is</em> she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather.&rdquo; He tacked that on in the tone of one who
deplores the inevitable; and went on quickly, &ldquo;You
needn&rsquo;t infer that I&rsquo;ve made an ass of myself or that
I&rsquo;m going to. In our position&hellip;&rdquo; He abandoned
that as being, perhaps, too obvious. &ldquo;What I mean to say
is,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that I can&rsquo;t understand about
Brenda. And it was such an infernally silly way of going about
things. Admitted that there was no earthly chance of the pater
giving his consent or anything like it; she needn&rsquo;t in any
case have made a damned spectacle of the affair. But that&rsquo;s
just like her. Probably did it all because she wanted to be
dramatic or some rot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then that I expressed my appreciation of the dramatic
quality of the incident, and was snubbed by his saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you realise just what this may mean, to all of
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had a vivid impression, in the darkness, of that sudden scowl
which made him look so absurdly like a youthful version of Sir
Edward Carson.</p>
<p>I was wondering why it should mean so much to all of them? Frank
Jervaise had admitted, for all intents and purposes, that he was in
love with the chauffeur&rsquo;s sister, so he, surely, need not
have so great an objection. And, after all, why was the family of
Jervaise so much better than the family of Banks?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it would be very terrible for you all if she
married this chap?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unthinkable,&rdquo; Jervaise replied curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be worse in a way than your marrying the
sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should never be such an infernal fool as to do a thing
like that,&rdquo; he returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she &hellip; have there been any tender passages
between you and Miss Banks?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he snapped viciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been too careful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, I don&rsquo;t think she likes
me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; was all my comment.</p>
<p>I needed no more explanations; and I liked Jervaise even less
than I had before. I began to wish that he had not seen fit to
confide in me. I had, thoughtlessly, been dramatising the incident
in my mind, but, now, I was aware of the unpleasant reality of it
all. Particularly Jervaise&rsquo;s part in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be absolutely certain, of course,&rdquo; he
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if she did like you?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to be very careful who I marry,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t particularly well off. All our
property is in land, and you know what sort of an investment that
is, these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried another line. &ldquo;And if you find your sister up at
the Home Farm; and Banks; what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kick him and bring her home,&rdquo; he said
decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing else for it, I suppose?&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously,&rdquo; he snarled.</p>
<p>We had come into a wood and it was very dark under the trees. I
wondered why I should restrain the impulse to strangle him and
leave him there? He was no good, and, to me, quite peculiarly
objectionable. It seemed, in what was then my rather fantastic
state of mind, that it would be a triumph of whimsicality. I should
certainly have resisted the impulse in any case, but my attention
was diverted from it at that moment by a sudden pattering of feet
along the leaves of the great trees under which we were
walking&mdash;light, clean, sharp, little dancing feet, springing
from leaf to leaf&mdash;dozens of them chasing each other, rattling
ecstatically up and down the endless terraces of wide foliage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it all, it&rsquo;s beginning to rain like
blazes,&rdquo; remarked the foolish Jervaise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much farther is it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He said we were &ldquo;just there.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<p>I saw the Home Farm first as a little square haze of yellow
light far up in the sky. I didn&rsquo;t realise the sharp rise in
the ground immediately in front of us, and that rectangular beacon,
high in the air, seemed a fantastically impossible thing. I pointed
it out to Jervaise who was holding his head down as if he were
afraid the summer rain might do some serious injury to his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one up, anyway,&rdquo; was his comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very far up,&rdquo; I murmured. I could not quite
believe, even then, that it could be a window. I was disappointed
when we had climbed the hill and stood only a few feet below the
beacon, to discover that this too, was another instance of the all
too credible commonplace. I suppose men like Frank Jervaise never
long to believe in the impossible. I was, however, agreeably
surprised to find that he could be nervous.</p>
<p>He hesitated, looking up at the prism of light that splayed out
through the first floor window, and set a silver fire to the
falling rain. &ldquo;Suppose we&rsquo;d better knock,&rdquo; he
grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you know whose window it is?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>Apparently he didn&rsquo;t. He made a dive into a deeper
obscurity and I lost him until I heard his knock. I was glad that
he should have knocked with such decent restraint, but all the
effect of it was instantly shattered by the response. For at his
first subdued rap, a dog with a penetratingly strident bark set up
a perfectly detestable clamour within the house. It was just as if
Jervaise&rsquo;s touch on the door had liberated the spring of some
awful rattle. Every lovely impulse of the night must have fled
dismayed, back into the peace and beauty of the wood; and I was
more than half inclined to follow.</p>
<p>Until that appalling racket was set loose I had been regarding
this midnight visit to the farm as a natural and enticing
adventure, altogether in keeping with the dramatic movement
preluded by the chime of the stable-clock. That confounded terrier,
whose voice so clearly proclaimed his breed, had dragged us down to
the baldest realism. We were intruders upon the decencies of
civilisation. That dog was not to be misled by any foolish whimsies
of the imagination. He was a thorough-going realist, living in a
tangible, smellable world of reality, and he knew us for what we
were&mdash;marauders, disturbers of the proper respectable peace of
twentieth century farms. He lashed himself into ecstasies of fury
against our unconventionality; he rose to magnificent paroxysms of
protest that passionately besought High Heaven and Farmer Banks to
open the door and let him get at us.</p>
<p>But no one came. There may have been other sounds coming from
the house besides that infuriated demand for vengeance, but all
inferior noises&mdash;and surely all other noises must have been
inferior to that clamour&mdash;were absorbed and flattened out of
existence. We were in a world occupied by the bark of a single dog,
and any addition to that occupation would have been
superfluous.</p>
<p>The owner of the voice was doing his level best now to get the
door down on his own account. I hoped he might succeed. I should
have excuse then to fly to the woods and claim sanctuary. As it
was, I retreated a couple of steps, holding my breath to ease the
pain of my nerves, and some old instinct of prayer made me lift my
face to the sky. I welcomed the cold, inquisitive touch of the
silent rain.</p>
<p>Then I became aware through the torture of prolonged
exasperation that my upturned face was lit from above; that a
steady candle was now perched on the very sill of the one
illuminated window; and that behind the candle the figure of a
woman stood looking down at me.</p>
<p>She appeared to be speaking.</p>
<p>I held my hands to my ears and shook my head violently to
intimate my temporary deafness; and the figure disappeared, leaving
the placid candle to watch me as it seemed with a kind of indolent
nonchalance.</p>
<p>I decided to pass on the news to Jervaise, and discovered that
besotted fool in a little trellised porch, stimulating the
execrations of the Irish terrier by a subdued inaudible knocking. I
was beginning to scream my news into his ear when silence descended
upon us with the suddenness of a catastrophe. It was as if the
heavens had been rent and all the earth had fallen into a muffled
chaos of mute despair.</p>
<p>I had actually began my shriek of announcement when all the
world of sound about us so inexplicably ceased to be, and I shut
off instantly on the word &ldquo;<em>Someone</em>&hellip;,&rdquo; a
word that as I had uttered it sounded like a despairing yelp of
mortal agony.</p>
<p>Out of the unearthly stillness, Jervaise&rsquo;s voice replied
in a frightened murmur, &ldquo;Someone coming,&rdquo; he said, as
if he, alone, had knowledge of and responsibility for that supreme
event.</p>
<p>And still no one came. The door remained steadfastly closed.
Outside the porch, the earth had recovered from the recent
disaster, and we could hear the exquisitely gentle murmur of the
rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damned odd,&rdquo; commented Jervaise. &ldquo;That cursed
dog made enough noise to wake the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was inspired to go out and search the window where burned the
indigent, just perceptibly, rakish candle.</p>
<p>She was there. She had returned to her eyrie after quelling the
racket in the hall, and now she leaned a little forward so that I
could see her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; she asked quietly.</p>
<p>Her voice was low and clear as the reed of a flute, but all
sounds had the quality of music at that instant of release.</p>
<p>I was nonplussed for the moment. I ought to have taken up the
key of high romance. She deserved it. Instead of that I dropped to
the awful commonplaces of a man in evening dress and a light
overcoat standing in the rain talking to a stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came up with Mr. Jervaise, Mr. Frank Jervaise,&rdquo; I
explained. &ldquo;He&mdash;he wants to see you. Shall I tell him
you&rsquo;re there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All serene, I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; whispered the voice of
Jervaise at my elbow, and then he cleared his throat and spoke up
at the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather an upset down at the Hall, Miss Banks; about
Brenda,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Might we come in a
minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather late, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; the vision
returned&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t only the ease of the silence, she
had a delicious voice&mdash;and added rather mischievously,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like anything,&rdquo; Jervaise said, and ducked his head
and hunched his shoulders, as if he had suddenly remembered the
possible susceptibility of his exposed face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it so very important?&rdquo; the soft, clear voice
asked, still, I thought, with a faint undercurrent of raillery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Miss Banks, it is,&rdquo; Jervaise implored,
risking his delicate face again.</p>
<p>She hesitated a moment and then said, &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo;
and disappeared, taking this time the dissipated candle with her. I
heard her address a minatory remark within the room to
&ldquo;Racket&rdquo;&mdash;most excellently described, I thought;
though I discovered later that I had, in imagination, misspelt him,
since he owed his name to the fact that his mother had sought her
delivery on the bed of a stored tennis-net.</p>
<p>Jervaise and I hurried back to the front door as if we were
afraid that Miss Banks might get there first; but she kept us
waiting for something like ten minutes before she came downstairs.
The silence of that interval was only broken by such nervous
staccato comments as &ldquo;Long time!&rdquo; &ldquo;Dressing,
presumably,&rdquo; and occasional throaty sounds of impatience from
Jervaise that are beyond the representative scope of typography. I
have heard much the same noises proceed from the throat of an
unhopeful pig engaged in some minor investigation.</p>
<p>The rain was falling less heavily, and towards the west a pale
blur of light was slowly melting its way through the darkness. I
noted that spot as marking the probable position of the setting
moon. I decided that as soon as this infernal inquisition was over,
I would get rid of Jervaise and find some God-given place in which
I might wait for the dawn. I knew that there must be any number of
such places between the Farm and the Hall. I was peering westward
towards the rolling obscurity of hills and woods that were just
beginning to bulk out of the gloom, when I heard the click of the
door latch.</p>
<p>I should not like to be put in the witness-box and
cross-examined by Jervaise as to my reason for entering the house
with him that night. All that part of me with which I have any sort
of real friendship, wanted quite definitely to stay outside. That
would have been the tactful thing to do. There was no reason why I
should intrude further on the mystery of Brenda&rsquo;s
disappearance; and as a matter of fact I was no longer very keenly
interested in that brilliant and fascinating young woman&rsquo;s
affairs. The plan that I had in mind when the door opened was to
say politely to Jervaise, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for you
here&rdquo;&mdash;I had a premonition that he would raise no
objection to that suggestion&mdash;and then when he and Miss Banks
were safely inside, I meant to go and find rapture in solitude. The
moon was certainly coming out; the dawn was due in three hours or
so, and before me were unknown hills and woods. I had no sort of
doubt that I should find my rapture. I may add that my plan did not
include any further sight of Jervaise, his family, or their
visitors, before breakfast next morning.</p>
<p>I had it all clear and settled. I was already thrilling with the
first ecstasies of anticipation. But when the door was opened I
turned my back on all that magical beauty of the night, and
accompanied Jervaise into the house like a scurvy little mongrel
with no will of its own.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t account for that queer change of purpose. It was
purely spontaneous, due to something quite outside the realm of
reason. I was certainly not in love with Anne, then. My only sight
of her had left an impression as of an amateur copy of a Rembrandt
done in Indian ink with a wet brush. It is true that I had heard
her voice like the low thrilling of a nightingale&mdash;following a
full Handel chorus of corncrakes.</p>
<hr />
<p>She had evidently spent an active ten minutes while we waited
for her. She had done her hair, and she was, so far as I could
judge from superficialities, completely dressed. Also she had
lighted the lamp in what I took to be the chief sitting-room of the
farm.</p>
<p>As a room it deserved attention, but it was not until I had been
there for ten minutes or more, that I realised all that the
furniture of that room was not. My first observations were solely
directed to Miss Banks.</p>
<p>Jervaise had grossly maligned her by saying that she was
&ldquo;frightfully pretty.&rdquo; No one but a fool would have
called her &ldquo;pretty.&rdquo; Either she was beautiful or plain.
I saw, even then, that if the light of her soul had been quenched,
she might appear plain. Her features were good, her complexion, her
colouring&mdash;she was something between dark and fair&mdash;but
she did not rely on those things for her beauty. It was the glow of
her individuality that was her surpassing charm. She had that
supremely feminine vitality which sends a man crazy with worship.
You had to adore or dislike her. There was no middle course.</p>
<p>And Jervaise quite obviously adored her. All that tactful
confession of his in the park had been a piece of artifice. It had
not, however, been framed to deceive <em>me</em>. I do not believe
that he considered me worth bothering about. No, those admissions
and denials of his had been addressed, without doubt, to a far more
important person than myself. They had been in the nature of a
remonstrance and assurance spoken to Frank Jervaise by the heir to
the estate; which heir was determined with all the force of his
ferocious nose and dominant chin to help him, that he would not
make a fool of himself for the sake of the daughter of a tenant
farmer. I had been nothing more than the register upon which he had
tentatively engraved that resolve. But he should have chosen a more
stable testament than this avowal made to a whimsically-minded
playwright with an absurd weakness for the beauties of a midnight
wood.</p>
<p>And if I had been a witness to his oath, I was, now, a witness
to his foreswearing.</p>
<p>He began well enough on the note proper to the heir of Jervaise.
He had the aplomb to carry that off. He stood on the hearthrug,
austere and self-controlled, consciously aristocrat, heir and
barrister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Miss Banks. Almost inexcusable to
disturb you at this time of night.&rdquo; He stopped after that
beginning and searched his witness with a stare that ought to have
set her trembling.</p>
<p>Anne had sat down and was resting her forearms on the table. She
looked up at him with the most charming insouciance when he paused
so portentously at the very opening of his address. Her encouraging
&ldquo;yes&rdquo; was rather in the manner of a child waiting for
the promised story.</p>
<p>Jervaise frowned and attempted the dramatic. &ldquo;My sister,
Brenda, has run away,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This evening at the end of the Cinderella. You knew we
were giving a dance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Precisely!&rdquo; Jervaise said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how extraordinary!&rdquo; replied Miss Banks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she here?&rdquo; asked Jervaise. He ought to have
snapped that out viciously, and I believe that was his intention.
But Anne&rsquo;s exquisitely innocent, absorbed gaze undid him; and
his question had rather the sound of an apology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, certainly not! Why ever should she come here?&rdquo;
Anne said with precisely the right nuance of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your brother here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It looks such an absurd little inexpressive word on paper, but
Anne made a song of it on two notes, combining astonishment with a
sincerity that was absolutely final. If, after that, Jervaise had
dared to say, &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; I believe I should have
kicked him.</p>
<p>How confounded he was, was shown by the change of attitude
evident in his next speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s horribly awkward,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! horribly,&rdquo; Anne agreed, with a charming
sympathy. &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, we can&rsquo;t find your brother, either,&rdquo;
Jervaise tried tactfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite see what that&rsquo;s got to do with
Brenda,&rdquo; Anne remarked with a sweet perplexity.</p>
<p>Apparently Jervaise did not wish to point the connection too
abruptly. &ldquo;We wanted the car,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and we
couldn&rsquo;t find him anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;s almost sure to have gone to sleep up in
the woods,&rdquo; Anne replied. &ldquo;Arthur&rsquo;s like that,
you know. He sort of got the habit in Canada or somewhere. He often
says that sometimes he simply can&rsquo;t bear to sleep under a
roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had already begun to feel a liking for Anne&rsquo;s brother,
and that speech of hers settled me. I knew that
&ldquo;Arthur&rdquo; was the right sort&mdash;or, at least, my
sort. I would have been willing, even then, to swap the whole
Jervaise family with the possible exception of Brenda, for this as
yet unknown Arthur Banks.</p>
<p>Jervaise&rsquo;s diplomacy was beginning to run very thin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it conceivable that
Brenda&hellip;&rdquo; he began gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Brenda what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to say&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; She leaned a little forward with an air of
expectancy that disguised her definite refusal to end his sentences
for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a most difficult situation, Miss Banks,&rdquo;
he said, starting a new line; &ldquo;and we don&rsquo;t in the
least know what to make of it. What on earth could induce Brenda to
run off like this, with no apparent object?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you know she really has?&rdquo; asked Anne.
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me anything, yet, have you? I mean,
she may have gone out into the Park to get cool after the dance, or
into the woods or anything. Why should you imagine that she
has&mdash;run away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I joined in the conversation, then, for the first time. I had
not even been introduced to Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very reasonable, surely, Jervaise,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;And wouldn&rsquo;t it&mdash;I hardly know her,
I&rsquo;ll admit&mdash;but wouldn&rsquo;t it be rather like your
sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far as I was concerned, Anne&rsquo;s suggestion carried
conviction. I was suddenly sure that our suspicions were all a
mistake.</p>
<p>Jervaise snubbed me with a brief glance of profoundest contempt.
He probably intended that commentary on my interruption to go no
further; but his confounded pose of superiority annoyed me to the
pitch of exasperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, my dear chap,&rdquo; I continued quickly,
&ldquo;your unfortunate training as a lawyer invariably leads you
to suspect a crime; and you overlook the obvious in your perfectly
unreasonable and prejudiced search for the
incriminating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jervaise&rsquo;s expression admirably conveyed his complete
boredom with me and my speeches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know anything about it,&rdquo; he said,
with a short gesture of final dismissal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Jervaise,&rdquo; Anne put in, &ldquo;what can
you possibly suspect, in this case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d suspect anything of anybody for the sake of
making a case of it,&rdquo; I said, addressing Anne. I wanted to
make her look at me, but she kept her gaze fixed steadily on
Jervaise, as if he were the controller of all destinies.</p>
<p>I accepted my dismissal, then, so far as to keep silence, but I
was annoyed, now, with Anne, as well as with Jervaise. &ldquo;What
on earth could she see in the fellow?&rdquo; I asked myself
irritably. I was the more irritated because he had so obviously
already forgotten my presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no reason to suspect anything yourself, Miss
Banks?&rdquo; he asked gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re suggesting that Brenda and Arthur have
run away together,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly,
perfectly certain that you&rsquo;re wrong, Mr. Jervaise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you know for certain that they
haven&rsquo;t?&rdquo; he returned.</p>
<p>She nodded confidently, and I thought she had perjured herself,
until Jervaise with evident relief said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad
of that; very. Do you mind telling me how you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By intuition,&rdquo; she said, without a trace of
raillery in her face or her tone.</p>
<p>I forgave her for ignoring me when she said that. I felt that I
could almost forgive Jervaise; he was so deliciously sold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve surely some other grounds for certainty
besides&mdash;intuition?&rdquo; he insisted anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What other grounds could I possibly have?&rdquo; Anne
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t, either of them, confided in
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confided? What sort of things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That there was, or might be, any&mdash;any sort of
understanding between them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that they have met&mdash;occasionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lately! Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brenda has been having lessons in driving the
motor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, I know that. You didn&rsquo;t mean that they had
been meeting here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; Anne said
definitely. All through that quick alternation of question and
answer she had, as it were, surrendered her gaze to him; watching
him with a kind of meek submission as if she were ready to do
anything she could to help him in his inquiry. And it was very
plain to me that Jervaise was flattered and pleased by her
attitude. If I had attempted Anne&rsquo;s method, he would have
scowled and brow-beaten me unmercifully, but now he really looked
almost pleasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you to help me like this, Miss
Banks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m very grateful to you. I
do apologise, most sincerely for dragging you out of bed at such an
unholy hour, but I&rsquo;m sure you appreciate my&mdash;our
anxiety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! of course,&rdquo; she agreed, with a look that I
thought horribly sympathetic.</p>
<p>I began to wonder if my first estimate of her&mdash;based to a
certain extent, perhaps, on Jervaise&rsquo;s admission that she did
not like him&mdash;had not been considerably too high. She might,
after all, be just an ordinary charming woman, enlivened by a
streak of minx, and eager enough to catch the heir of Jervaise if
he were available. How low my thought of her must have sunk at that
moment! But they were, now, exchanging courtesies with an air that
gave to their commonplaces the effect of a flirtation.</p>
<p>I distracted my attention. I couldn&rsquo;t help hearing what
they said, but I could refrain from looking at Anne. She was
becoming vivacious, and I found myself strangely disliking her
vivacity. It was then that I began to take note of the furnishing
of the room which, when I considered it, was so peculiarly not in
the manner of the familiar English farm-house. Instead of the plush
suite, the glass bell shades, the round centre table, and all the
other stuffy misconceptions so firmly established by the
civilisation of the nineteenth century, I discovered the authentic
marks of the old English &aelig;sthetic&mdash;whitewashed walls and
black oak. And the dresser, the settles, the oblong table, the
rush-bottomed chairs, the big chest by the side wall, all looked
sturdily genuine; venerably conscious of the boast that they had
defied the greedy collector and would continue to elude his most
insidious approaches. Here, they were in their proper surroundings.
They gave the effect of having carelessly lounged in and settled
themselves; they were like the steady group of
&ldquo;regulars&rdquo; in the parlour of their familiar inn.</p>
<p>I came out of my reflection on the furniture to find that
Jervaise was going, at last. He was smiling and effusive, talking
quickly about nothing, apologising again for the unseemliness of
our visit. Anne was pathetically complacent, accepting and
discounting his excuses, and professing her willingness to help in
any way she possibly could. &ldquo;But I really and truly expect
you&rsquo;ll find Brenda safe at home when you get back,&rdquo; she
said, and I felt that she honestly believed that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so; I hope so,&rdquo; Jervaise responded, and then
they most unnecessarily shook hands.</p>
<p>I thought that it was time to assert myself above the clatter of
their farewells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might add, Miss Banks,&rdquo; I put in, &ldquo;that
we&rsquo;ve been making a perfectly absurd fuss about nothing at
all. But, no doubt, you&rsquo;re used to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me, then, for the first time since I had come into
the house; and I saw the impulse to some tart response flicker in
her face and die away unexpressed. We stood and stared at one
another for a long half-second or so; and when she looked away I
fancied that there was something like fear in her evasion. It
seemed to me that I saw the true spirit of her in the way her
glance refused me as some one with whom she did not care to sport.
Her voice, too, dropped, so that I could not catch the murmur of
her reply.</p>
<p>We had, indeed, recognised each other in that brief meeting of
our eyes. Some kind of challenge had passed between us. I had dared
her to drop that disguise of trickery and show herself as she was;
and her response had been an admission that she acknowledged not
me, but my recognition of her.</p>
<p>How far the fact that I had truly appraised her real worth might
influence her, in time, to think gently of me, I could not guess;
but I hoped, even a little vaingloriously, that she would respond
to our mutual appreciation of truth. I had shown her, I believed,
how greatly I admired the spirit she had been at such pains to
conceal during that talk in the honest sitting-room of the Home
Farm. And I felt that her failure to resent the impertinence of my
&ldquo;No doubt, you&rsquo;re used to that,&rdquo; had been due to
an understanding of something she and I had in common against the
whole solid, stolid, aristocratic family of Jervaise.</p>
<p>Moreover, she gave me what I counted as two more causes for
hopefulness before we left the house. The first was her repetition,
given, now, with a more vibrating sincerity, of the belief that we
should find Brenda safely at home when we got back to the Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sure you will, Mr. Jervaise,&rdquo; she said, and
the slight pucker of anxiety between her eyebrows was an earnest
that even if her belief was a little tremulous, her hope, at least,
was unquestionably genuine.</p>
<p>The second sign was the acceptance of a hackneyed commonplace;
the proffer of a friendly message through the medium of a
clich&eacute; which, however false in its general application,
offered a short cut to the interpretation of feeling. Racquet who
had maintained a well-bred silence from the first moment of his
mistress&rsquo;s reproof, had honoured me with his approval while
we sat in the farm-house sitting-room, and sealed the agreement by
a friendly thrust of his nose as we said
&ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne did not look at me as she spoke, but her soft comment,
&ldquo;You are fond of dogs,&rdquo; seemed to me a full
acknowledgment of our recognition of each other&rsquo;s
quality.</p>
<p>I must admit, however, that at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning
one&rsquo;s sense of values is not altogether normal.</p>
<h3 class="title"><a name="Ch_III" id="Ch_III"></a>III</h3>
<h2>Frank Jervaise</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>I should have preferred to maintain a thoughtful, experiencing
silence throughout our walk home. I had plenty of material for
reflection. I wanted, now, to look at all this disappearing Brenda
business from a new angle. I had a sense of the weaving of plots,
and of the texture of them; such a sense as I imagine a blind man
may get through sensitive finger-tips. Two new characters had come
into my play, and I knew them both for principals. That opening act
without Brenda, Arthur Banks, or his sister was nothing more than a
prologue. The whole affair had begun again to fascinate my
interest. Moreover, I was becoming aware of a stern, half-tragic
background that had not yet come into proper focus.</p>
<p>And the circumstances of our walk home were of a kind that I
find peculiarly stimulating to the imagination. The sky was
clearing. Above us, widening pools of deep sky, glinting here and
there, with the weak radiance of half-drowned stars, opened and
closed again behind dispersing wreaths of mist. While in the west,
a heaped indigo gloom that might in that light have been mistaken
for the silhouette of a vast impending forest, revealed at one edge
a thin haze of yellow silver that stretched weak exploring arms of
light towards the mysterious obscurity of the upper clouds. I knew
precisely how that sky would look at sunset, but at moonset it had
a completely different quality that was at once more ethereal and
more primitive. It seemed to me that this night-sky had the
original, eternal effect of all planetary space; that it might be
found under the leaping rings of Saturn or in the perpetual gloom
of banished Neptune. Compared to the comprehensible, reproducible
effects of sunlight, it was as the wonder of the ineffable to the
beauty of a magnificent picture.</p>
<p>But I was not left for many minutes to the rapture of
contemplation. Even the primitive had to give place to the movement
of our tiny, civilised drama. Jervaise and I were of the race that
has been steadily creating a fiction of the earth since the first
appearance of inductive science in the days of prehistoric man; and
we could not live for long outside the artificial realism of the
thing we were making. We were not the creatures of a process, but
little gods in a world-pantheon.</p>
<hr />
<p>I made no attempt to check him when he began to talk. I knew by
the raised tone of his voice&mdash;he was speaking quite a third
above his ordinary pitch&mdash;that he was pleasantly excited by
our interview with Anne: an excitement that he now wished either to
conceal, or, if that were impossible, to attribute to another
cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It occurs to me that there are one or two very puzzling
points about that visit of ours, Melhuish,&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least two,&rdquo; I agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which are?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d prefer to hear yours first,&rdquo; I said,
having no intention of displaying my own.</p>
<p>He was so eager to exhibit his cleverness that he did not press
me for my probably worthless deductions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in the first place,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;did it
strike you as a curious fact that Miss Banks, and she alone, was
apparently disturbed by that dog&rsquo;s infernal
barking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hadn&rsquo;t struck me,&rdquo; I admitted; and just
because I had not remarked that anomaly for myself, I was instantly
prepared to treat it as unworthy of notice. &ldquo;I suppose her
father and mother and the servants, and so on, heard her let us
in,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Jervaise jeered at that. &ldquo;Oh! my good man,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; I returned peevishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put it to you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whether in those
circumstances the family&rsquo;s refusal to make an appearance
admits of any ordinary explanation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could see, now, that it did not; but having committed myself
to a point of view, I determined to uphold it. &ldquo;Why
<em>should</em> they come down?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Common curiosity would be a sufficient inducement, I
should imagine,&rdquo; Jervaise replied with a snort of contempt,
&ldquo;to say nothing of a reasonable anxiety to know why any one
should call at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning. It isn&rsquo;t
usual, you know&mdash;outside the theatrical world,
perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I chose to ignore the sneer conveyed by his last sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may be very heavy sleepers,&rdquo; I tried, fully
aware of the inanity of my suggestion.</p>
<p>Jervaise laughed unpleasantly, a nasty hoot of derision.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a damned fool,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
human being isn&rsquo;t born who could sleep through that
hullabaloo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I relinquished that argument as hopeless, and having no other at
the moment, essayed a weak reprisal. &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s your
explanation?&rdquo; I asked in the tone of one ready to discount
any possible explanation he might have to make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;There can
be only one. They were expecting us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that Miss Banks was deliberately lying to us
all the time?&rdquo; I challenged him with some heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if she were expecting us&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which she never denied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And had warned all her people&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As she had a perfect right to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes her out a liar, in effect,&rdquo; I protested.
&ldquo;I mean, she implied, if she didn&rsquo;t actually state,
that she knew nothing whatever of your sister&rsquo;s
movements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which may have been true,&rdquo; he remarked in the
complacent tone of one who waits to formulate an unimpeachable
theory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord! How?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brenda may have been expected and not have
arrived,&rdquo; he explained, condescending, at last, to point out
all the obvious inferences I had missed. &ldquo;In which case, my
friend, Miss Banks&rsquo;s <em>suppressio veri</em> was, in my
judgment, quite venial. Indeed, she was, if the facts are, as I
suppose, perfectly honest in her surprise. Let us assume that she
had arranged to let Brenda in, at say twelve-thirty, and having her
father and mother under her thumb, had warned them to take no
notice if Racquet started his cursed shindy in the middle of the
night. The servant may have been told that Mr. Arthur might be
coming. You will notice, also, that Miss Banks had not, at
one-thirty, gone to bed, although we may infer that she had
undressed. Furthermore, it is a fair assumption that she saw us
coming, and having, by then given up, it may be, any hope of seeing
Brenda, she was, no doubt, considerably at a loss to account for
our presence. Now, does that or does it not cover the facts, and
does it acquit Miss Banks of the charge of perjury?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was forced, something reluctantly, to concede an element of
probability in his inferences, although his argument following the
legal tradition was based on a kind of average law of human motive
and took no account of personal peculiarities. He did not try to
consider what Anne would do in certain circumstances, but what
would be done by that vaguely-conceived hermaphrodite who figures
in the Law Courts and elsewhere as &ldquo;Anyone.&rdquo; I could
hear Jervaise saying, &ldquo;I ask you, gentlemen, what would you
have done, what would Anyone have done in such a case as
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; I commented, and added, &ldquo;It still makes
Miss Banks appear rather&mdash;double-faced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; Jervaise replied. &ldquo;Put
yourself in her place and see how it works!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Lord!&rdquo; I murmured, struck by the grotesque idea
of Jervaise attempting to see life through the eyes of Anne.
Imagine a rhinoceros thinking itself into the experiences of a
skylark!</p>
<p>Jervaise bored ahead, taking no notice of my interruption.
&ldquo;Assuming for the moment the general probability of my
theory,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;mayn&rsquo;t we hazard the further
assumption that Brenda was going to the farm in the first instance
to meet Banks? His sister, we will suppose, being willing to
sanction such a more or less chaperoned assignation. Then, when the
pair didn&rsquo;t turn up, she guesses that the meeting is off for
some reason or another, but obviously her friendship for
Brenda&mdash;to say nothing of loyalty to her brother&mdash;would
make her conceal the fact of the proposed assignation from us.
Would you call that being &lsquo;double-faced&rsquo;? I
shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes; it&rsquo;s all very reasonable,&rdquo; I agreed
petulantly. &ldquo;But how does it affect the immediate situation?
Do you, for instance, expect to find your sister at home when we
get back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; assented Jervaise definitely. &ldquo;I
believe that Miss Banks had some good reason for being so sure that
we should find her there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am not really pig-headed. I may not give way gracefully to
such an opponent as Jervaise, but I do not stupidly persist in a
personal opinion through sheer obstinacy. And up to
Jervaise&rsquo;s last statement, his general deductions were, I
admitted to myself, not only within the bounds of probability but,
also, within distance of affording a tolerable explanation of
Anne&rsquo;s diplomacy during our interview. But&mdash;and I
secretly congratulated myself on having exercised a subtler
intuition in this one particular, at least&mdash;I did not believe
that Anne expected us to find Brenda at the Hall on our return. I
remembered that anxious pucker of the brow and the pathetic
insistence on the belief&mdash;or might it not better be described
as a hope?&mdash;that Brenda had done nothing final.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t made a bad case,&rdquo; I conceded;
&ldquo;but I differ as to your last inference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think we shall find Brenda at
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; I replied aggressively.</p>
<p>I expected him to bear me down under a new weight of argument
founded on the psychology of Anyone, and I was startled when he
suddenly dropped the lawyer and let out a whole-hearted
&ldquo;Damnation,&rdquo; that had a ring of fine sincerity.</p>
<p>I changed my tone instantly in response to that agreeably human
note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be quite mistaken, of course,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;I hope to goodness I am. By the way, do you know if she has
taken any luggage with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be sure,&rdquo; Jervaise said.
&ldquo;Olive&rsquo;s been looking and there doesn&rsquo;t seem to
be anything missing, but we&rsquo;ve no idea what things she
brought down from town with her. If she&rsquo;d been making plans
beforehand&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>We came out of the wood at that point in our discussion, and
almost at the same moment the last barrier of cloud slipped away
from before the moon. She was in her second quarter, and seemed to
be indolently rolling down towards the horizon, the whole pose of
the scene giving her the effect of being half-recumbent.</p>
<p>I turned and looked at Jervaise and found him facing me with the
full light of the moon on his face. He was frowning, not with the
domineering scowl of the cross-examining counsel, but with a
perplexed, inquiring frown that revealed all the boy in him.</p>
<p>Once at Oakstone he had got into a serious scrape that had begun
in bravado and ended by a public thrashing. He had poached a trout
from the waters of a neighbouring landowner, who had welcomed the
opportunity to make himself more than usually objectionable. And on
the morning before his thrashing, Jervaise had come into my study
and confessed to me that he was dreading the coming ordeal. He was
not afraid of the physical pain, he told me, but of the shame of
the thing. We were near to becoming friends that morning. He
confessed to no one but me. But when the affair was over&mdash;he
bore himself very well&mdash;he resumed his usual airs of
superiority, and snubbed me when I attempted to sympathise with
him.</p>
<p>And I saw, now, just the same boyish dread and perplexity that I
had seen when he made his confession to me at Oakstone. He looked
to me, indeed, absurdly unchanged by the sixteen years that had
separated the two experiences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Melhuish,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
altogether blaming Brenda in one way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;s really in love with
Banks?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How can any
one know? But it has been going on a long time&mdash;weeks, anyhow.
They were all getting nervous about it at home. The mater told me
when I came down this afternoon. She wanted me to talk to B. about
it. I was going to. She doesn&rsquo;t take any notice of Olive.
Never has.&rdquo; He stopped and looked at me with an appeal in his
face that begged contradiction.</p>
<p>We were standing still in the moonlight at the edge of the wood
and the accident of our position made me wonder if Jervaise&rsquo;s
soul also hesitated between some gloomy prison of conventional
success and the freedom of beautiful desires. I could find no
words, however, to press that speculation and instead I attempted,
rather nervously, to point the way towards what I regarded as the
natural solution of the immediate problem. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;the idea of a marriage between Banks and your sister
doesn&rsquo;t appear so unreasonable. The Bankses are evidently
good old yeoman stock on the father&rsquo;s side. It is a mere
accident of luck that you should be the owners of the land and not
they.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theoretically, yes!&rdquo; he said with a hint of
impatience. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got to consider the
opinions&mdash;prejudices, if you like&mdash;of all my
people&mdash;to say nothing of the neighbours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! put the neighbours first,&rdquo; I exclaimed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what we think other people will think that counts
with most of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Jervaise returned gloomily.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand what the idea of family means to
people like my father and mother. They&rsquo;ve been brought up in
it. It has more influence with them than religion. They&rsquo;d
prefer any scandal to a m&eacute;salliance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your sister&rsquo;s case?&rdquo; I put in, a trifle
shocked by the idea of the scandal, and then discovered that he had
not been thinking of Brenda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not in that case,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but&hellip;&rdquo; he paused noticeably before adding,
&ldquo;The principle remains the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it chiefly a matter of courage?&rdquo; I
asked. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as if &hellip; the m&eacute;salliance
were in any way disgraceful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t absolve myself from the charge of hypocrisy in the
making of that speech. I was thinking of Jervaise and Anne, and I
did not for one moment believe that Anne would ever marry him. My
purpose was, I think, well-intentioned. I honestly believed that it
would be good for him to fall in love with Anne and challenge the
world of his people&rsquo;s opinion for her sake. But I blame
myself, now, for a quite detestable lack of sincerity in pushing
him on. I should not have done it if I had thought he had a real
chance with her. Life is very difficult; especially for the
well-intentioned.</p>
<p>Jervaise shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so
infernally complicated by this affair of Brenda&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Yet it has seemed simple enough to him, I reflected, an hour
before. &ldquo;Kick <em>him</em> and bring <em>her</em>
home,&rdquo; had been his ready solution of the difficulties he
thought were before us. Evidently Anne&rsquo;s behaviour during our
talk at the farm had had a considerable effect upon his opinions.
That, and the moon. I feel strongly inclined to include the
moon&mdash;lazily declining now towards the ambush of a
tumulus-shaped hill, crowned, as is the manner of that country,
with a pert little top-knot of trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Complicated or simplified?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Complicated; damnably complicated,&rdquo; he replied
irritably. &ldquo;Brenda&rsquo;s a little fool. It isn&rsquo;t as
if she were in earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t honestly believe that she&rsquo;s in
love with Banks?&rdquo; I asked, remembering his &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know. How can any one know,&rdquo; of a few minutes
earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s so utterly unreliable&mdash;in every
way,&rdquo; he equivocated. &ldquo;She always has been. She
isn&rsquo;t the least like the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you count yourself as another
exception?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in that way, Brenda&rsquo;s way,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s scatter-brained; you can&rsquo;t get round that.
Going off after the dance in that idiotic way. It&rsquo;s
maddening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there are two questions that must be resolved
before we can get any further,&rdquo; I commented. &ldquo;The first
is whether your sister has gone back&mdash;she may have been safe
in bed for the last hour and a half for all we know. And the second
is whether she is honestly in love with Banks. From what I&rsquo;ve
heard of him, I should think it&rsquo;s very likely,&rdquo; I added
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Jervaise had his hands in his pockets and was staring up at the
moon. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a bad chap in some ways,&rdquo; he
remarked, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s no getting over the fact that
he&rsquo;s our chauffeur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw that. No badge could be quite so disgraceful in the eyes
of the Jervaises as the badge of servitude. Our talk there, by the
wood, had begun to create around us all the limitations of
man&rsquo;s world. I was forgetting that we were moving in the free
spaces of a planetary republic. And then I looked up and saw the
leaning moon, whimsically balanced on the very crown of the topknot
that gave a touch of impudence to the pudding-basin hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of that hill?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He looked at it absently for a moment before he said, &ldquo;The
people about here call it &lsquo;Jervaise Clump.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s
a landmark for miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no getting away from it. The Jervaises had conquered
all this land and labelled it. I watched the sharp edge of the
tree-clump slowly indenting the rounded back of the moon; and it
seemed to me that Jervaise-Clump was the solid permanent thing; the
moon a mere incident of the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Lord! Lord! What bosh it all is!&rdquo; I
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All what?&rdquo; Jervaise asked sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This business of distinctions; of masters and servants;
of families in possession and families in dependence,&rdquo; I
enunciated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t such dangerous bosh as socialism,&rdquo;
Jervaise replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of socialism,&rdquo; I said;
&ldquo;I was thinking of interplanetary space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jervaise blew contemptuously. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk
rot,&rdquo; he said, and I realised that we were back again on the
old footing of our normal relations. Nevertheless I made one more
effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t rot,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If it is, then
every impulse towards beauty and freedom is rot, too.&rdquo; (I
could not have said that to Jervaise in a house, but I drew
confidence from the last tip of the moon beckoning farewell above
the curve of the hill.) &ldquo;Your, whatever it is you feel for
Miss Banks&mdash;things like that &hellip; all our little efforts
to get away from these awful, clogging human rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had given him his opportunity and he took it. He was
absolutely ruthless. &ldquo;No one but a fool tries to be
superhuman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had turned and was walking back in the direction of the Hall,
and I followed him, humiliated and angry.</p>
<p>It was so impossible for me at that moment to avoid the
suspicion that he had led me on by his appealing confidences solely
in order to score off me when I responded. It is not, indeed,
surprising that that should be my reaction while the hurt of his
sneer still smarted. For he had pricked me on a tender spot. I
realised the weakness of what I had said; and it was a
characteristic weakness. I had been absurdly unpractical, as usual,
aiming like a fool, as Jervaise had said, at some
&ldquo;superhuman&rdquo; ideal of freedom that perhaps existed
solely in my own imagination; and would certainly be regarded by
Mr. and Mrs. Jervaise and their circle of county friends as the
vapourings of a weak mind. In short, Jervaise had made me aware of
my own ineptitude, and it took me a full ten minutes before I could
feel anything but resentment.</p>
<p>We had passed back through the kitchen garden with its gouty
espaliers, and come into the pleasance before I forgave him.
According to his habit, he made no apology for his rudeness, but
his explicit renewal of confidence in me more nearly approached an
overt expression of desire for my friendship than anything I had
ever known him to show hitherto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Melhuish,&rdquo; he said, stopping suddenly in
the darkness of the garden. I could not &ldquo;look&rdquo; with
much effect, but I replied, a trifle sulkily, &ldquo;Well?
What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she hasn&rsquo;t come back&hellip;&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that we can do anything more till
to-morrow,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use trying to find her, of course,&rdquo; he agreed,
irritably, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;d better talk things over with the
governor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can be of any help&hellip;&rdquo; I remarked
elliptically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be if you start that transcendental
rot,&rdquo; he returned, as if he already regretted his
condescension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of rot do you want me to talk?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Common sense,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>I resisted the desire to say that I was glad he acknowledged the
Jervaise version of common sense to be one kind of rot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All serene,&rdquo; I agreed.</p>
<p>He did not thank me.</p>
<p>And when I looked back on the happenings of the two hours that
had elapsed since Jervaise had fetched me out of the improvised
buffet, I was still greatly puzzled to account for his marked
choice of me as a confidant. It was a choice that seemed to signify
some weakness in him. I wondered if he had been afraid to trust
himself alone with Anne at the Farm; if he were now suffering some
kind of trepidation at the thought of the coming interview with his
father? I found it so impossible to associate any idea of weakness
with that bullying mask which was the outward expression of Frank
Jervaise.</p>
<h3 class="title"><a name="Ch_IV" id="Ch_IV"></a>IV</h3>
<h2>In the Hall</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>We found the family awaiting us in the Hall&mdash;Mr. and Mrs.
Jervaise, Olive, and &ldquo;Ronnie&rdquo; Turnbull, whose desire to
become one of the family by marrying its younger daughter was
recognised and approved by every one except the young lady herself.
Ronnie had evidently been received into the fullest confidence.</p>
<p>We had come in by the back door and made our way through the
rather arid cleanliness of the houses&rsquo; administrative
departments, flavoured with a smell that combined more notably the
odours of cooking and plate-polish. The transition as we emerged
through the red baize door under the majestic panoply of the
staircase, was quite startling. It was like passing from the
desolate sanitation of a well-kept workhouse straight into the
lighted auditorium of a theatre. That contrast dramatised, for me,
the Jervaises&rsquo; tremendous ideal of the barrier between owner
and servant; but it had, also, another effect which may have been
due to the fact that it was, now, three o&rsquo;clock in the
morning.</p>
<p>For just at the moment of our transition I had the queerest
sense not only of having passed at some previous time through a
precisely similar experience, but, also, of taking part in a
ridiculous dream. At that instant Jervaise Hall, its owners,
dependants and friends, had the air of being not realities but
symbols pushed up into my thought by some prank of the fantastic
psyche who dwells in the subconscious. I should not have been
surprised at any incongruity in the brief passing of that
illusion.</p>
<p>The sensation flashed up and vanished; but it left me with the
excited feeling of one who has had a vision of something
transcendental, something more vivid and real than the common
experiences of life&mdash;just such a feeling as I have had about
some perfectly absurd dream of the night.</p>
<hr />
<p>Mr. Jervaise was a man of nearly sixty, I suppose, with a
clean-shaven face, a longish nose, and rather loose cheeks which
fell, nevertheless, into firm folds and gave him a look of weak
determination. I should have liked to model his face in clay; his
lines were of the kind that give the amateur a splendid chance in
modelling.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jervaise was taller and thinner than her husband, but lost
something by always carrying her head with a slight droop as if she
were for ever passing through a low doorway. Her features were
sharper than his&mdash;she had a high hawk nose and a thin line of
a mouth&mdash;but either they were carelessly arranged or their
relative proportions were bad, for I never felt the least desire to
model her. Jervaise&rsquo;s face came out as a presentable whole,
my memory of his wife delivers the hawk nose as the one salient
object of what is otherwise a mere jumble.</p>
<p>Old Jervaise certainly looked the more aristocratic of the pair,
but Mrs. Jervaise was a woman of good family. She had been a Miss
Norman before her marriage&mdash;one of the Shropshire Normans.</p>
<hr />
<p>The four people in the Hall looked as if they had reached the
stage of being dreadfully bored with each other when we arrived.
They did not hear us immediately, and as my momentary dream
dissolved I had an impression of them all as being on the verge of
a heartrending yawn. They perked up instantly, however, when they
saw us, turning towards us with a movement that looked concerted
and was in itself a question.</p>
<p>Frank Jervaise, striding on ahead of me, answered at once, with
a gloomy shake of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she there?&rdquo; his mother asked. And
&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she been there at all?&rdquo; she persisted
when Frank returned a morose negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did you see?&rdquo; put in young Turnbull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Banks,&rdquo; Frank said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite sure that Brenda hadn&rsquo;t been
there?&rdquo; Olive Jervaise added by way of rounding up and
completing the inquiry.</p>
<p>It was then Frank&rsquo;s turn to begin an unnecessary
interrogation by saying &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t here, then?&rdquo;
He must have known that she was not, by their solicitude; but if he
had not put that superfluous question, I believe I should; though I
might not have added as he did, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely
certain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Turnbull then exploded that phase of the situation by
remarking, &ldquo;I suppose you know that the car&rsquo;s
gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank was manifestly shocked by that news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord! no, I didn&rsquo;t. How do you know?&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left my own car in the ditch, just outside the
Park,&rdquo; Ronnie explained. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know in the least
how it happened. Suppose I was thinking of something else. Anyway,
I&rsquo;ve fairly piled her up, I&rsquo;m afraid. I was coming back
from the vicarage, you know. And then, of course, I walked up here,
and Mr. Jervaise was good enough to offer me your car to get home
in; and when we went out to the garage, it had gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But was it there when you went to get your own
car?&rdquo; Frank asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bothered if I know,&rdquo; Ronnie confessed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying hard to remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jervaise sighed heavily and took a little stroll across to
the other side of the Hall. He seemed to me to be more perturbed
and unhappy than any of the others.</p>
<p>Frank stood in a good central position and scowled enormously,
while his mother, his sister, and Ronnie waited anxiously for the
important decision that he was apparently about to deliver. And
they still looked to him to find some expedient when his impending
judgment had taken form in the obvious pronouncement, &ldquo;Looks
as if they&rsquo;d gone off together, somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very dreadful,&rdquo; Mrs. Jervaise said; and
then Olive slightly lifted the awful flatness of the dialogue by
saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have guessed. It&rsquo;s absurd that we let
the thing go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One couldn&rsquo;t be sure,&rdquo; her mother
protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to wait till you&rsquo;re sure, of
course&hellip;&rdquo; Frank remarked brutally, with a shrug of his
eyebrows that effectively completed his sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so impossible to believe that she would do a thing
like that,&rdquo; his mother complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Point is, what&rsquo;s to be done now,&rdquo; Ronnie
said. &ldquo;By gad, if I catch that chap, I&rsquo;ll wring his
neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jervaise, who was taking a lonely promenade up and down the
far side of the Hall, looked up more hopefully at this threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we can <em>catch</em> him,&rdquo; Frank commented.
&ldquo;He has stolen the car, for one thing&hellip;&rdquo; his
inflection implied that catching Banks might be only the beginning
of the trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, once we&rsquo;ve got him,&rdquo; returned Ronnie
hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an ass,&rdquo; Frank snubbed him.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t advertise it all over the county that he has
gone off with Brenda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see&hellip;&rdquo; Ronnie began, but Mrs.
Jervaise interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so unfortunate that the Atkinsons should have been
here,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one will know, in any case,&rdquo; Olive added.</p>
<p>Those avowals of their real and altogether desperate cause for
distress raised the emotional tone of the two Jervaise women, and
for the first time since I had come into the Hall, they looked at
me with a hint of suspicion. They made me feel that I was an
outsider, who might very well take this opportunity to
withdraw.</p>
<p>I was on the point of accepting the hint when Frank Jervaise
dragged me into the conclave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think, Melhuish?&rdquo; he asked, and then
they all turned to me as if I might be able in some miraculous way
to save the situation. Even old Jervaise paused in his melancholy
pacing and waited for my answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is so little real evidence, at present,&rdquo; I
said, feeling their need for some loophole and searching my mind to
discover one for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really does seem almost impossible that Brenda should
have&mdash;run away with that man,&rdquo; Mrs. Jervaise pleaded
with the beginning of a gesture that produced the effect of wanting
to wring her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s under age, too,&rdquo; Frank put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that mean they can&rsquo;t get married?&rdquo; asked
Ronnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not legally,&rdquo; Frank said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such madness, such utter madness,&rdquo; his
mother broke out in a tone between lament and denunciation. But she
pulled herself up immediately and came back to my recent
contribution as presenting the one possible straw that still
floated in this drowning world. &ldquo;But, as Mr. Melhuish
says,&rdquo; she went on with a little gasp of annoyance, &ldquo;we
really have very little evidence, as yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has occurred to me to wonder,&rdquo; I tried,
&ldquo;whether Miss Jervaise might not have been moved by a sudden
desire to drive the car by moonlight&hellip;&rdquo; I was going on
to defend my suggestion by pleading that such an impulse would, so
far as I could judge, be quite in character, but no further
argument was needed. I had created a sensation. My feeble straw had
suddenly taken the form of a practicable seaworthy raft, big enough
to accommodate all the family&mdash;with the one exception of
Frank, who, as it were, grasped the edge of this life-saving
apparatus of mine, and tested it suspiciously. His preliminary and
perfectly futile opening to the effect that the moon had already
set, was, however, smothered in the general acclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! of <em>course</em>! So she may!&rdquo; Mrs. Jervaise
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we might have thought of that, certainly,&rdquo;
Olive echoed. &ldquo;It would be so <em>like</em>
Brenda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Ronnie hopefully murmured &ldquo;That <em>is</em>
possible, quite possible,&rdquo; as a kind of running
accompaniment.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Jervaise began to draw in to the family group, with
what seemed to me quite an absurd air of meaning to find a place on
the raft of the big rug by the fireplace. Indeed, they had all
moved a little closer together. Only Frank maintained his
depressing air of doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been an infernally long time,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it now? Half-past three?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may have had an accident,&rdquo; Olive suggested
cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or gone a lot farther than she originally meant
to,&rdquo; Ronnie substituted; the suggestion of an accident to
Brenda obviously appearing less desirable to him than it apparently
did to Brenda&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; Mr. Jervaise said, taking the lead
for the first time, &ldquo;that there may very well be half a dozen
reasons for her not having returned; but I can&rsquo;t think of one
that provides the semblance of an excuse for her going in the first
instance. Brenda must be&mdash;severely reprimanded. It&rsquo;s
intolerable that she should be allowed to go on like
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has always been spoilt,&rdquo; Olive said in what I
thought was a slightly vindictive aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s so impossibly headstrong,&rdquo; deplored
Mrs. Jervaise.</p>
<p>Her husband shook his head impatiently. &ldquo;There is a limit
to this kind of thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She must be made to
understand&mdash;<em>I</em> will make her understand that we draw
the line at midnight adventures of this kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jervaise and Olive agreed warmly with that decision, and
the three of them drew a little apart, discussing, I inferred, the
means that were to be adopted for the limiting of the runaway, when
she returned. But I was puzzled to know whether they were finally
convinced of the truth of the theory they had so readily adopted.
Were they deceiving, or trying very hard, indeed, to deceive
themselves into the belief that the whole affair was nothing but a
prank of Brenda&rsquo;s? I saw that my casual suggestion had a
general air of likelihood, but if I had been in their place, I
should have demanded evidence before I drew much consolation from
so unsupported a conclusion.</p>
<p>I joined young Turnbull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea of yours, Melhuish,&rdquo; Ronnie said.</p>
<p>Frank grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no sort of grounds for it, you know,&rdquo; I
explained. &ldquo;It was only a casual suggestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jolly convincing one, though,&rdquo; Turnbull
congratulated me. &ldquo;So exactly the sort of thing she would do,
isn&rsquo;t it, Frank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t have thought she&rsquo;d have been gone
so long,&rdquo; Jervaise replied. He looked at me as he continued,
&ldquo;And how does it fit with that notion of ours about Miss
Banks having expected her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was only a guess,&rdquo; I argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better evidence for it than you had for your
guess,&rdquo; he returned, and we drifted into an indeterminate
wrangle, each of us defending his own theory rather because he had
had the glory of originating it than because either of us had, I
think, the least faith in our explanations.</p>
<p>It was Ronnie who, picking up the thread of our deductions from
the Home Farm interview in the course of our discussion, sought to
reconcile us and our theories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might have meant to go up to the Farm,&rdquo; he
suggested, &ldquo;and changed her mind when she got outside.
Nothing very unlikely in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why the devil should she have made an appointment at
the Home Farm in the first instance?&rdquo; Frank replied with some
cogency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she ever did,&rdquo; I put in unwisely, thereby
provoking a repetition of the evidence afforded by Miss
Banks&rsquo;s behaviour, particularly the damning fact that she,
alone, had responded to Racquet&rsquo;s demand for our instant
annihilation.</p>
<p>And while we went on with our pointless arguments and the other
little group of three continued to lay plans for the re-education
of Brenda, the depression of a deeper and deeper ennui weighed upon
us all. The truth is, I think, that we were all waiting for the
possibility of the runaway&rsquo;s return, listening for the sound
of the car, and growing momentarily more uneasy as no sound came.
No doubt the Jervaises were all very sleepy and peevish, and the
necessity of restraining themselves before Turnbull and myself
added still another to their many sources of irritation.</p>
<p>I put the Jervaises apart in this connection, because Ronnie was
certainly very wide awake and I had no inclination whatever to
sleep. My one longing was to get back, alone, into the night. I was
fretting with the fear that the dawn would have broken before I
could get away. I had made up my mind to watch the sunrise from
&ldquo;Jervaise Clump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Jervaise who started the break-up of the party. She
was attacked by a craving to yawn that gradually became
irresistible. I saw the incipient symptoms of the attack and
watched her with a sympathetic fascination, as she clenched her
jaw, put her hand up to her lips, and made little impatient
movements of her head and body. I knew that it must come at last,
and it did, catching her unawares in the middle of a
sentence&mdash;undertaken, I fancy, solely as a defence against the
insidious craving that was obsessing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; she said, with a mincing, apologetic
gesture of her head; and then &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; Having
committed the solecism, she found it necessary to draw attention to
it. She may have been a Shropshire Norman, but at that relaxed hour
of the night, she displayed all the signs of the orthodox genteel
attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ve been so tired,&rdquo;
she apologised.</p>
<p>But, indeed, she did owe us an apology for her yawning fit
affected us all like a virulent epidemic. In a moment we were every
one of us trying to stifle the same desire, and each in our own way
being overcome. I must do Frank the justice to say that he, at
least, displayed no sign of gentility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Lord, mater, you&rsquo;ve started us now,&rdquo; he
said, and gave away almost sensuously to his impulses, stretching
and gaping in a way that positively racked us with the longing to
imitate him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, my dear, no necessity for you,&rdquo; began Mr.
Jervaise, yawned more or less politely behind a very white,
well-kept hand, and concluded, &ldquo;no necessity for you or Olive
to stay up; none whatever. We cannot, in any case, <em>do</em>
anything until the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if she comes in, now,&rdquo; supplemented Olive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I&rsquo;m almost sure she will,&rdquo; affirmed Mrs.
Jervaise.</p>
<p>And she must have put something of genuine confidence into her
statement, for automatically we all stopped talking for a few
seconds and listened again with the ears of faith for the return of
the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as I said,&rdquo; Olive began again, abruptly ending
the unhopeful suspense of our pause, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing
more we can do by sitting up. And there&rsquo;s certainly no need
for you to overtire yourself, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, really not,&rdquo; urged Ronnie politely, &ldquo;nor
for you, either, sir,&rdquo; he added, addressing his host.
&ldquo;What I mean is, Frank and I&rsquo;ll do all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather, let&rsquo;s get a drink,&rdquo; Frank agreed.</p>
<p>We wanted passionately to get away from each other and indulge
ourselves privately in a very orgie of gapes and stretchings. And
yet, we stuck there, idiotically, making excuses and little polite
recommendations for the others to retire, until Frank with a
drastic quality of determination that he sometimes showed, took
command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, mater,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you go to
bed.&rdquo; And he went up to her, kissed her in the mechanical way
of most grown-up sons, and gently urged her in the direction of the
stairs. She submitted, still with faint protestations of
apology.</p>
<p>Olive followed, and with a last feint of hospitality, her father
brought up the tail of the procession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming for a drink?&rdquo; Frank asked me with a jerk of
his head towards the extemporised buffet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, thanks. I think not,&rdquo; I said, seeking the
relief afforded by the women&rsquo;s absence; although, now, that I
could indulge my desire without restraint, the longing to gape had
surprisingly vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to bed?&rdquo; Jervaise suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Bed&rsquo;s the best place, just now,&rdquo; I
lied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right oh! Good-night, old chap,&rdquo; Ronnie said
effusively.</p>
<p>I pretended to be going upstairs and they did not wait for me to
disappear. As soon as they had left the Hall, I sneaked down again,
recovered from the cloak-room the light overcoat I had worn on our
expedition to the Farm&mdash;I have no idea to whom that overcoat
belonged&mdash;borrowed a cap, and let myself out stealthily by the
front door.</p>
<p>As I quietly shut the door behind me, a delicious whiff of
night-stock drifted by me, as if it had waited there for all those
long hours seeking entrance to the stale, dry air of the Hall.</p>
<hr />
<p>And it must have been, I think, that scent of night-stock which
gave me the sense of a completed episode, or first act, as I stood
alone, at last, on the gravel sweep before the Hall. Already the
darkness was lifting. The dawn was coming high up in the sky, a
sign of fair weather.</p>
<p>I have always had a sure sense of direction, and I turned
instinctively towards the landmark of my promised destination,
although it was invisible from that side of the Hall&mdash;screened
by the avenue of tall forest trees, chiefly elms, that led up from
the principal entrance to the Park. I had noticed one side road
leading into this avenue as I had driven up from the station the
previous afternoon, and I sought that turning now, with a feeling
of certainty that it would take me in the right direction. As,
indeed, it did; for it actually skirted the base of &ldquo;Jervaise
Clump,&rdquo; which touched the extreme edge of the Park on that
side.</p>
<p>As I cautiously felt my way down the avenue&mdash;it was still
black dark under the dark trees&mdash;and later up the tunnel of
the side road which I hit upon by an instinct that made me feel for
it at the precise moment when I reached the point of its junction
with the avenue&mdash;I returned with a sense of satisfaction to
the memory of the last four hours. I was conscious of some kind of
plan in the way the comedy of Brenda&rsquo;s disappearance had been
put before us. I realised that, as an art form, the plan was
essentially undramatic, but the thought of it gave me,
nevertheless, a distinct feeling of pleasure.</p>
<p>I saw the experience as a prelude to this lonely adventure of
mine&mdash;a prelude full of movement and contrast; but I had no
premonition of any equally diverting sequel.</p>
<p>The daylight was coming, and I believed, a trifle regretfully,
that that great solvent of all mysteries would display these
emotions of the night as the phantasmagoria of our imagination.</p>
<p>Before I had reached the end of the tunnel through the wood and
had come out into the open whence I could, now, see the loom of
Jervaise Clump swelling up before me in the deep, gray gloom of
early dawn, I had decided that my suggestion had been prompted by
an intuition of truth. Brenda had fallen under the spell of the
moon, and gone for a long drive in the motor. She had taken Banks
with her, obviously; but that action need not be presumed to have
any romantic significance. And the Jervaises had accepted that
solution. They had been more convinced of its truth than I had
imagined. They would never have gone to bed, tired as they were, if
they had not been satisfied that Brenda had committed no other
indiscretion than that of indulging herself in the freak of a
moonlight drive. It had, certainly, been unduly prolonged; but, as
old Jervaise had said, there might be half a dozen reasons to
account for that.</p>
<p>As I turned off the road and breasted the lower slopes of the
hill, I was constructing the details of the Jervaises&rsquo;
explanatory visit to the Atkinsons. I had reached the point of
making Mrs. Jervaise repeat the statement she had made in the Hall
that &ldquo;dear Brenda was so impossibly headstrong,&rdquo; when I
heard the sweet, true notes of some one ahead of me, whistling,
almost miraculously, in tune.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t one man in a million who can whistle absolutely
true.</p>
<h3 class="title"><a name="Ch_V" id="Ch_V"></a>V</h3>
<h2>Daybreak</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>He was whistling Schubert&rsquo;s setting of &ldquo;Who is
Sylvia?&rdquo; and as I climbed slowly and as silently as I could
towards him, I fitted the music to the words of the second
verse:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Is she kind as she is fair?</p>
<p>For beauty lives with kindness.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Only a man in love, I thought, could be whistling that air with
such attention and accuracy. He hit that unusual interval&mdash;is
it an augmented seventh?&mdash;with a delicacy that was quite
thrilling.</p>
<p>He had the world to himself, as yet. The birds of the morning
had not begun their orisons, while the birds of the night, the owls
and the corncrakes had, happily, retired before the promise of that
weakening darkness which seemed nevertheless to have reached a
moment of suspense&mdash;indeed, I fancied that it was darker, now,
than when I had come out of the Hall a quarter of an hour
before.</p>
<p>The whistler had stopped before I reached the crest of the hill,
and after trying vainly to locate his whereabouts in the gloom, I
leaned up against one of the outermost trunks of the perky little
clump of trees, and facing East awaited developments. A thin, cold
wind had sprung up, and was quietly stirring the leaves above me to
an uneasy sibilance. I heard, now, too, an occasional sleepy
twitter as if a few members of the orchestra had come into their
places and were indolently testing the tune of their pipes. It came
into my mind that the cold stir of air was the spirit of the dying
night, fleeing westward before the sun. Also, I found myself
wondering what would be the effect on us all if one morning we
waited in vain for the sunrise? I tried to picture my own emotions
as the truth was slowly borne in upon me that some unprecedented
calamity had silently and without any premonition befallen the
whole world of men. Would one crouch in a terror of apprehension? I
could not see it that way. I believed that I should be trembling
with a furious excitement, stirred to the very depths by so
inspiring and adventurous a miracle. I had forsaken my speculation
and was indulging in the philosophical reflection that a real and
quite unaccountable miracle, the more universal the better, would
be the most splendid justification of life I could possibly
conceive, when the whistler began again, only a few yards away from
me.</p>
<p>I could just see him now, sitting propped against the trunk of
another tree, but I waited until he had finished what I chose to
believe was the third verse of his lyric before I hailed him. It
came to me that I might test his quality by continuing the play in
proper form, so when he paused, I went on with the speech of the
&ldquo;host&rdquo; which immediately follows the song in &ldquo;The
Two Gentlemen of Verona.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How now?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Are you sadder than you
were before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not move, not even to turn his head towards me, and I
inferred that he was aware of my presence before I spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, one of the search party?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>I went over and sat down by him. I felt that the situation was
sufficiently fantastic to permit of free speech. I did not know who
he was and I did not care. I only knew that I wanted to deliver
myself of the dreams my lack of sleep had robbed from me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only one,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;unless you also
belong to the very small and select party of searchers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I fancy that he turned his head a little towards me, but I kept
my gaze fixed on the indigo masses of the obscure prospect before
us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you looking for?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much who as what,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And even
then it isn&rsquo;t so easy to define. I&rsquo;ve heard men call it
beauty and mystery, and things like that; but just now it seemed to
me that what I wanted most was a universal miracle&mdash;some
really inexplicable happening that would upset every law the
physicists have ever stated. I was thinking, for instance, how
thrilling it would be if the sun did not rise this morning. One
would know, then, that all our scientific guesses at laws were just
so many baby speculations founded on nothing more substantial than
a few thousand years of experience which had, by some chance given
always more or less the same results. Like a long run on the red,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well? Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was greatly stimulated by his encouragement. Here, at last,
was the listener I had been waiting for all through the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One gets so infernally sick of everything happening
according to fixed rules,&rdquo; I continued. &ldquo;And the more
you learn the nearer you are to the deadly ability of being able to
foretell the future. If we ever do reach that point in our
intellectual evolution, I only hope that I shan&rsquo;t be there to
see it. Imagine the awful ennui of a world where the expected
always happened, and next year&rsquo;s happenings were always
expected! And yet we go on seeking after knowledge, when we ought
surely to avoid it, as the universal kill joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; commented my new friend on what I felt to be a
note of doubtful agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t agree with that?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I see what you&rsquo;re after, in a way,&rdquo; he
acknowledged; &ldquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that it
amounts to very much&mdash;practically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was a trifle disappointed. I had not expected any insistence
on the practical from a man who could whistle Schubert and
Shakespeare to the dawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, practically! Perhaps not,&rdquo; I replied with a
hint of contempt for anything so common.</p>
<p>He gave a little self-conscious laugh. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
get away from the practical in this life,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Even in&mdash;&rdquo; He seemed to bite off the beginning of
confidence with an effort. &ldquo;You may dream half the
night,&rdquo; he began again, with a thin assumption of making an
impersonal statement, &ldquo;but before the night&rsquo;s over
you&rsquo;ll come up against the practical, or the practicable, or
the proper right thing, or something, that makes you see what a
fool you are. The way this world&rsquo;s run, you can&rsquo;t avoid
it, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew that what he said was true, but I found it damping. It
fitted all too well with the coming realism of day. The contours of
the landscape were slowly resigning themselves to the formal
attitudes imposed upon them by expectation. The blood of colour was
beginning to run weakly through the monochrome. The nearer slopes
of the hill and the leaves of the trees were already professing a
resolute green. Moment by moment the familiar was taking prudent
shape, preparing itself for the autocrat whose outriders were
multitudinously busy about their warnings of his approach.
Presently the scene would take on the natural beauty of our desire,
but the actual process of transformation rather depressed me that
morning. I had been so deeply in love with the night.</p>
<p>I took up my companion&rsquo;s last sentence&mdash;spoken, I
fancied, with a suggestion of brooding antagonism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think the world might be &lsquo;run,&rsquo; at least,
more interestingly?&rdquo; I put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More sensibly,&rdquo; he said in a voice that hinted a
reserve of violence. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no <em>sense</em> in it,
the way we look at things. Only we don&rsquo;t look at &rsquo;em,
most of us, not with any intelligence. We just take everything for
granted because we happen to be used to it, that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But would any form of socialism&hellip;&rdquo; I tried
tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m a socialist,&rdquo; he
returned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t belong to any union, or anything of
that kind.&rdquo; He stopped and looked at me with a defiant stare
that was quite visible now. &ldquo;You know who I am, I
suppose?&rdquo; he challenged me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No idea,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Banks, the chauffeur,&rdquo; he said, as if he were
giving himself up as a well-known criminal.</p>
<p>I was not entirely unprepared for that reply, but I had no
tactful answer to make. I rejected the spontaneous impulse that
arose, as I thought quite fantastically, to say &ldquo;I believe I
have met your sister;&rdquo; and fell back on an orthodox
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I tried to convey the effect that I still
waited to be shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re staying up at the Hall?&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the week-end only,&rdquo; I admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been a pretty fuss there, I take it?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some,&rdquo; I acknowledged.</p>
<p>He set his resolute-looking mouth and submitted me to
cross-examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been looking for me?&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way. Frank Jervaise and I went up to your
father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between two and three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we left about half-past two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; I asked. I was thinking of his sister, and
could find no application for this question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Jervaise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;Miss Brenda? No. She hadn&rsquo;t come
in when I left the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About four. I came straight here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not back, eh?&rdquo; he commented with a soft, low
whistle, that mingled, I thought, something of gladness with its
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know where she is, then?&rdquo; I
ventured.</p>
<p>He turned and looked at me suspiciously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see why I should help your friends,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>I realised that my position was a difficult one. My sympathies
were entirely with Banks. I felt that if there was to be any
question of making allowances, I wanted to be on the side of Brenda
and the Home Farm. But, at the same time, I could not deny that I
owed something&mdash;loyalty, was it?&mdash;to the Jervaises. I
pondered that for a few seconds before I spoke again, and by then I
had found what I believed to be a tolerable attitude, though I was
to learn later that it compromised me no less than if I had frankly
thrown in my lot with the Banks faction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And I would
sooner you gave me no confidences, now I come to think of it. But I
should like you to know, all the same, that I&rsquo;m not taking
sides in this affair. I have no intention, for instance, of telling
them at the Hall that I&rsquo;ve seen you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The daylight was flooding up from the North-West, now, in a
great stream that had flushed the whole landscape with colour; and
I could see the full significance of honest inquiry in my
companion&rsquo;s face as he probed me with his stare. But I could
meet his gaze without confusion. My purpose was single enough, and
if I had had a moment&rsquo;s doubt of him when he failed to
respond to my mood of fantasy; I was now fully prepared to accept
him without qualification.</p>
<p>He was not like his sister in appearance. He favoured the
paternal stock, I inferred. He was blue-eyed and fairer than Anne,
and the tan of his face was red where hers was dusky. Nevertheless,
I saw a likeness between them deeper than some family trick of
expression which, now and again, made me feel their kinship. For
Banks, too, gave me the impression of having a soul that came
something nearer the surface of life than is common in average
humanity&mdash;a look of vitality, zest, ardour&mdash;I fumbled for
a more significant superlative as I returned his stare. And yet
behind that ardour there was, in Arthur Banks, at least, a hint of
determination and shrewdness that I felt must be inherited from the
sound yeoman stock of his father.</p>
<p>Our pause of mutual investigation ended in a smile. He held out
his hand with a pleasant frankness that somehow proclaimed the
added colonial quality of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but anyway
I couldn&rsquo;t give you any confidences, yet. I don&rsquo;t know
myself, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going back to the Hall?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that, either,&rdquo; he said, and
added, &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t go back as the chauffeur,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, indeed, there was little of the chauffeur in his
appearance, just then. He was wearing a light tweed suit and brown
brogues, and his clothes sat upon him with just that touch of
familiarity, of negligence, that your professional servant&rsquo;s
mufti can never accomplish.</p>
<p>There was a new air of restlessness about him since he had put
me under cross-examination. He looked round him in the broadening
day as if he were in search of something, or some one, hopefully
yet half-despairingly expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here&mdash;if you&rsquo;d sooner I
went&hellip;&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>He had risen to his feet after his last statement and was
looking back towards the Hall, but he faced me again when I
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; he said with a hint of weariness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t likely that&hellip;&rdquo; He broke off
and threw himself moodily down on the grass again before he
continued, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I couldn&rsquo;t trust you.
But you can see for yourself that it&rsquo;s better I
shouldn&rsquo;t. When you get back to the Hall, you might be asked
questions and for your own sake it&rsquo;d look better if you
didn&rsquo;t know the answers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, quite,&rdquo; I agreed, and added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
stay and see the sun rise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see the sun for some time,&rdquo; he
remarked. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a lot of cloud and mist for it
to break through. It&rsquo;s going to be a scorcher
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; I replied; and for a few minutes we
discussed weather signs like any other conventional Englishmen. A
natural comparison led us presently to the subject of Canada. But
through it all he bore himself as a man with a preoccupation he
could not forget; and I was looking for a good opening to make an
excuse of fatigue and go back to the Hall, when something of the
thought that was intriguing him broke through the surface of his
talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back there as soon as I can,&rdquo; he
said with a sudden impatience. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s room to turn
round in Canada without hitting up against a notice board and
trespassing on the preserves of some landed proprietor. I&rsquo;d
never have come home if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the old people.
They thought chauffering for Mr. Jervaise would be a chance for me!
Anyhow my father did. He&rsquo;s got the feeling of being
dependent. It&rsquo;s in his bones like it is with, all of
&rsquo;em&mdash;on the estate. It&rsquo;s a tradition. Lord, the
old man would be horrified, if he knew! The Jervaises are a sort of
superior creation to him. We&rsquo;ve been their tenants for God
knows how many hundred years. And serfs before that, I suppose. I
get the feeling myself, sometimes. It&rsquo;s infectious. When you
see every one kow-towing to old Jervaise as if he were the angel
Gabriel, you begin to feel as if there must be something in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The full day had come, and the cold draught of air that had
preceded the sunrise came now from behind me as if the spirits of
the air had discovered that their panic-stricken flight had been a
mistake and were tentatively returning to inquire into the new
conditions. The birds were fully awake now, and there was a
tremendous gossiping and chattering going on, that made me think of
massed school-children in a railway station, twittering with the
excitement of their coming excursion. In the North-East the gray
wall of mist was losing the hardness of its edge, and behind the
cloud the sky was bleaching to an ever paler blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; I said, as my companion paused,
&ldquo;the Jervaises aren&rsquo;t anything particular as a family.
They haven&rsquo;t done anything, even in the usual way, to earn
ennoblement or fame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve squatted,&rdquo; Banks said,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve done. Set themselves down
here in the reign of Henry II., and sat tight ever
since&mdash;grabbing commons and so on, now and again, in the usual
way, of course. The village is called after them, Thorp-Jervaise,
and the woods and the hills, and half the labourers in the
neighbourhood have got names like Jarvey and Jarvis. What I mean is
that the Jervaises mayn&rsquo;t be of any account in London, or
even in the county, alongside of families like Lord
Garthorne&rsquo;s; but just round here they&rsquo;re the owners and
always have been since there have been any private owners. Their
word&rsquo;s law. If you don&rsquo;t like it, you can get out, and
that&rsquo;s all there is about it.&rdquo; He gazed thoughtfully in
front of him and thrust out his lower lip. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to
get out,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;unless&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hesitated to prompt him, fearing the possibly inquisitive
sound of the most indirect question, and after what I felt was a
very pregnant silence, he continued rather in the manner of one
allusively submitting a case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you get to a point where you feel as if no
game&rsquo;s worth winning if you can&rsquo;t play it fair and
open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as the other side play fair with you,&rdquo; I
commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can afford to,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;They get
every bit of pull there is to have. I told you we&rsquo;ve been
tenants of the Home Farm ever since there&rsquo;s been a Home Farm,
but old Jervaise could turn my father out any time, at six
months&rsquo; notice. Would, too. Probably have to, for the sake of
public opinion. Well, would you call that playing fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said with emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people would,&rdquo; he replied gloomily. I was
wondering what his own &ldquo;pull&rdquo; might be, the pull he
would not use because the use of it conflicted with his ideal of
playing the game. I was inclined, with a foolish romanticism to toy
with the notion of some old blood relationship between the families
of Jervaise and Banks&mdash;some carefully hidden scandal that
might even throw a doubt on the present owner&rsquo;s right of
proprietorship. I was still rebuilding that foolish, familiar story
of the lost heir, when my new friend put an end to further
speculation by saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the good of thinking about
that&mdash;yet? Why, I don&rsquo;t even know&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not resist a direct question this time.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even know what?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was forgetting,&rdquo; he said. He got to his feet
again, looked round for a moment, and then gave a yawn which seemed
to spring from a nervous rather than a muscular origin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good my compromising you, just now,&rdquo; he said
with a friendly smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve probably guessed more,
already, than&rsquo;ll be altogether convenient for you when you
see the family at breakfast. Perhaps, we&rsquo;ll meet again some
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying here till Monday,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know if I am,&rdquo; he replied with a
whimsical twist of his firm mouth. &ldquo;Well, so long,&rdquo; he
went on quickly. &ldquo;Glad to have met you, anyway.&rdquo; He
nodded with a repetition of that frank, engaging smile of his, and
turned away.</p>
<p>He did not take the road by which I had found Jervaise Clump,
but descended the hill on the opposite side; and, after he had gone
for five minutes or so, I got up and took a view of the prospect in
that direction. I had no thought of spying upon him. I just wished
to see if the Home Farm lay over there, as I guessed it must from
my memory of the general lie of the land during our moonlit return
to the Hall.</p>
<p>I was right. The farm was clearly visible from the northern
slope of the hill&mdash;an L-shaped, low, white house with a high,
red-tiled roof. It stood on another little tumulus about a mile
away, a small replica of Jervaise Clump; and the whole house was
visible above the valley wood that lay between us.</p>
<p>At first I could not decide why the effect of the place gave me
an impression of being unusual, and finally decided that this
apparent air of individuality was due to the choice of site. In
that country all the farms were built in the lower lands, crouching
under the lee of woods and hills, humbly effacing themselves before
the sovereignty of the Hall. The Home Farm alone, as far as I could
see, presented a composed and dignified face to its overlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a quality about these Bankses,&rdquo; I thought,
and then corrected the statement by adding, &ldquo;about the
children, at least.&rdquo; From what Arthur Banks had said, I
gathered that his father conformed to the faith of the estate, both
in act and spirit.</p>
<p>I stared at the Farm for a few minutes, wondering what that
French wife might be like. I found it difficult to picture the
ci-devant governess in those surroundings, and more particularly as
the mother of these two fascinating children. They, like their
home, produced an effect of being different from the common
average&hellip;.</p>
<p>I became aware that the green of woods and grass had leapt to
attention, and that sprawling shadows had suddenly come into being
and were giving a new solidity to the landscape. Also, I felt a
touch of unexpected warmth on my right cheek.</p>
<p>I returned to the place where Banks and I had talked, and sat
down again facing the glorious light of the delivered sun. And
almost at once I was overcome by an intense desire to sleep. My
purpose of walking back to the Hall, undressing and going to bed
had become impossible. I stretched myself full length on the turf,
and surrendered myself, exquisitely, to the care of the
sunlight.</p>
<h3 class="title"><a name="Ch_VI" id="Ch_VI"></a>VI</h3>
<h2>Morning</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>I awoke suddenly to the realisation of sound. The world about me
was alive with a murmurous humming. It was as if in passing through
the silent aisles of sleep, some door had been unexpectedly thrown
open and let in the tumultuous roar of life from without&mdash;or
as if after a brief absence I had returned and with one movement
had re-established all the communications of my body.</p>
<p>All sense of tiredness had left me. I opened my eyes and saw
that the sun had leapt far up into the sky. The whole population of
Jervaise Clump was plunged into the full bustle of its daily
business. Industrious bees were methodically visiting the
buttercups; their bustling, commercial eagerness in marked contrast
to the bluebottles and flies that seemed to choose their point of
alighting with a sham intentness which did not disguise their lack
of any definite purpose. Now and again a feral, domineering wasp
would join the crowd, coming up with the air of a fussy,
inquisitive overseer.</p>
<p>I looked at my watch and found that the time was a quarter past
eight. I had been asleep for nearly three hours. I had no idea what
time the Jervaises had breakfast, but I knew that it was high time
I got back to the Hall and changed my clothes.</p>
<p>I unbuttoned my coat and looked down at my shirt front and
thought how incongruous and silly that absurd garb of evening dress
appeared in those surroundings.</p>
<p>And as I trotted back to the Hall, I found a symbol in my dress
for the drama of the night. It was, I thought, all artificial and
unreal, now that I looked back upon it in the blaze of a brilliant
August morning. Beginning with the foolishness of a dance at that
time of year&mdash;even a &ldquo;tennis-dance&rdquo; as they called
it&mdash;the subsequent theatrical quality of the night&rsquo;s
adventure seemed to me, just then, altogether garish and fantastic.
I began to wonder how far I had dramatised and distorted the actual
events by the exercise of a romantic imagination? In the sweet
freshness of the familiar day, I found myself exceedingly inclined
to be rational. Also, I was aware of being quite unusually
hungry.</p>
<p>The front door of the Hall was standing wide open, and save for
a glimpse of the discreet John very busy in his shirt-sleeves, I
saw no one about. I was glad to reach my room unobserved. I knew
that my feeling was unreasonable, but entering that sedate house,
under the blaze of the morning sun, I was ashamed of my tawdry
dress. A sense of dissipation and revelry seemed to hang about
me&mdash;and of an uncivilised dirtiness.</p>
<p>A cold bath and a change of clothes, however, fully restored my
self-respect; and when I was summoned by the welcome sound of a
booming gong, the balance of sensation was kicking the other beam.
My sleep in the open had left me finally with a feeling of
superiority. I was inclined to despise the feeble, stuffy creatures
who had been shut up in a house all night.</p>
<p>I knew the topography of the house fairly well after my
night&rsquo;s experience of it, and inferred the breakfast-room
without any difficulty. But when I reached the door I stood and
listened in considerable astonishment. Luckily, I was not tempted
to make the jaunty entrance my mood prompted. I had not seen a soul
as I had made my way from my room in the north wing down into the
Hall. The place seemed to be absolutely deserted. And, now, in the
breakfast-room an almost breathless silence was broken only by the
slow grumbling of one monotonous voice, undulating about the
limited range of a minor third, and proceeding with the steady
fluency of a lunatic&rsquo;s muttering. I suppose I ought to have
guessed the reasonable origin of those sounds, but I didn&rsquo;t,
not even when the muttering fell to a pause and was succeeded by a
subdued chorus, that conveyed the effect of a score of people
giving a concerted but strongly-repressed groan. After that the
first voice began again, but this time it was not allowed to mumble
unsupported. A murmured chant followed and caricatured it,
repeating as far as I could make out the same sequence of sounds.
They began &ldquo;Ah! Fah! Chah! Hen&hellip;.&rdquo; That continued
for something like a minute before it came to a ragged close with
another groan. Then for a few seconds the original voice continued
its grumbling, and was followed by an immense quiet.</p>
<p>I stared through the open door of the Hall at the gay world of
colour outside and wondered if I was under the thrall of some queer
illusion. But as I moved towards the garden with a vague idea of
regaining my sanity in the open air, the silence in the
breakfast-room was broken by the sigh of a general movement, the
door was opened from within, and there poured out a long procession
of servants: a grave woman in black, a bevy of print-gowned maids,
and finally John&mdash;all of them looking staid and a trifle
melancholy, they made their way with a kind of hushed timidity
towards the red-baized entrance that led to the freedoms of their
proper condition.</p>
<p>Within the breakfast-room a low chatter of voices was slowly
rising to the level of ordinary conversation.</p>
<p>My entrance was anything but jaunty. This was the first
intimation I had received of the Jervaises&rsquo; piety; and my
recognition of the ceremonial of family worship to which I had so
unintuitively listened, had evoked long undisturbed memories of my
boyhood. As I entered the breakfast-room, I could not for the life
of me avoid a feeling of self-reproach. I had been naughty again.
My host, taking the place of my father, would be vexed because I
had missed prayers.</p>
<p>My reception did little to disperse my sense of shame. The air
of Sunday morning enveloped the whole party. Even Hughes and Frank
Jervaise were dressed as for a special occasion in black tail-coats
and gray trousers that boasted the rigidity of a week&rsquo;s
pressing. Not only had I been guilty of cutting family prayers; I
was convicted, also of disrespect on another count. My blue serge
and bright tie were almost profane in those surroundings. The
thought of how I had spent the night convicted me as a
thorough-going Pagan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you managed to get a little sleep, Mr.
Melhuish,&rdquo; Mrs. Jervaise said tepidly. &ldquo;We are having
breakfast half an hour later than usual, but you were so very late
last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I began to mumble something, but she went on, right over me,
speaking in a voice that she obviously meant to carry &ldquo;And
Brenda isn&rsquo;t down even now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;In fact
she&rsquo;s having breakfast in her own room, and I am not at all
sure that we shan&rsquo;t keep her there all day. She has the
beginning of a nasty cold brought on by her foolishness&mdash;and,
besides, she has been very, very naughty and will have to be
punished.&rdquo; She gave a touch of grim playfulness to her last
sentence, but I should not in any case have taken her statement
seriously. If I knew anything of our Brenda, it was that she was
not the sort of young lady who would submit to being kept in her
own room as a punishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the cold won&rsquo;t be serious,&rdquo; was all I
could find to say.</p>
<p>I looked at Mr. Jervaise, who was standing despondently by the
fireplace, but he did not return my glance. He presented, I
thought, the picture of despair, and I suffered a sharp twinge of
reaction from my championship of the Banks interest at sunrise.
Those two protagonists of the drama, Banks and Brenda, were so
young, eager and active. Life held so much promise for them. This
ageing man by the fireplace&mdash;he must have been nearly
sixty&mdash;had probably ceased to live for his own interests. His
ambitions were now centred in his children. I began to feel an
emotional glow of sympathy for him in his distress. Probably this
youngest, most brilliant, child of his was also the most tenderly
loved. It might well be that his anxiety was for her rather than
for himself; that the threat to his pride of family was almost
forgotten in his sincere wish for his daughter&rsquo;s happiness.
It would appear so certain to him that she could never find
happiness in a marriage with Arthur Banks.</p>
<p>And with that thought a suspicion of my late companion of the
hill-top leapt into my mind. He had hinted at some influence or
&ldquo;pull&rdquo; over Brenda&rsquo;s father that might perhaps be
used in a last emergency, although the use of it implied the taking
of a slightly dishonourable advantage. Was it not probable, I now
wondered, that this influence was to be obtained by working on
Jervaise&rsquo;s too tender devotion to his daughter? Was she,
perhaps, to be urged as a last resource to bear on that gentle
weakness by threat or cajolery?</p>
<p>I began to wish that I had not been quite so friendly with Mr.
Banks. I had been led away by the scent and glamour of the night.
Here, in this Sunday morning breakfast-room, I was able for the
first time to appreciate the tragedy in its proper relation to the
facts of life. I saw that Brenda&rsquo;s rash impulsiveness might
impose a quite horrible punishment on her too-devoted father.</p>
<p>I turned away towards one of the window-seats. Miss Tattersall
and Nora Bailey were sitting together there, pretending a
conversation while they patiently awaited the coming of breakfast.
Mrs. Jervaise was talking now to her elder daughter; Frank was
arguing some point with Gordon Hughes, and as I felt unequal to
offering comfort to the lonely head of the house, so evidently
wrapped in his sorrow, I preferred to range myself with the fourth
group. I thought it probable that the sympathies of those two young
women might at the moment most nearly correspond to my own.</p>
<p>I was surprised to be greeted by Miss Tattersall with what had
all the appearance of a discreetly covert wink, and I raised my
eyebrows with that air of half-jocular inquiry which I fancied she
would expect from me. She evaded the implied question, however, by
asking me what time I &ldquo;really got to bed, after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun was up before I went to sleep,&rdquo; I replied,
to avoid the possible embarrassment of her comments should I admit
to having slept in the open air; and then John and a female acolyte
came in with the long-desired material of breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; I commented softly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m simply
ravenous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; Miss Tattersall said. &ldquo;You deserve
to go without breakfast for having missed prayers,&rdquo; and added
in precisely the same undertone of conventional commonplace,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she came back at all last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, having thus piqued my curiosity, she gave me no opportunity
to gratify it. She checked the question that my change of
expression must have foreshadowed by a frown which warned me that
she could not give any reason for her suspicion in that
company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later on,&rdquo; she whispered, and got up from her seat
in the window, leaving me to puzzle over the still uncertain
mystery of Brenda&rsquo;s disappearance. Miss Bailey had not,
apparently, overheard the confidence. She did not, in any case,
relinquish for an instant that air of simple, attentive innocence
which so admirably suited the fresh prettiness of her style.</p>
<p>There was little conversation over the breakfast table. We were
all glad to find an excuse for silence either in the pretence or
reality of hunger. Old Jervaise&rsquo;s excuse was, quite
pathetically, only a pretence; but he tried very hard to appear
engrossed in the making of a hearty meal. His manner had begun to
fascinate me, and I had constantly to check myself from staring at
him. I found it so difficult to account satisfactorily for the
effect of dread that he in some way conveyed. It was, I thought,
much the effect that might have been produced by a criminal in
danger of arrest.</p>
<p>But all of us, in our different ways, were more than a little
uncomfortable. The whole air of the breakfast-table was one of
dissimulation. Gordon Hughes made occasional efforts in
conversation that were too glaringly irrelevant to the real subject
of our thoughts. And with each beginning of his, the others,
particularly Olive, Mrs. Jervaise, and little Nora Bailey, plunged
gallantly into the new topic with spasmodic fervour that expended
itself in a couple of minutes, and horribly emphasised the blank of
silence that inevitably followed. We talked as people talk who are
passing the time while they wait for some great event. But what
event we could be awaiting, it was hard to imagine&mdash;unless it
were the sudden return of Brenda, with or without Banks.</p>
<p>And, even when we had all finished, and were free to separate,
we still lingered for unnecessary minutes in the breakfast-room, as
if we were compelled to maintain our pretence until the last
possible moment.</p>
<p>Old Jervaise was the first to go. He had made less effort to
disguise his preoccupation than any of us, and now his exit had
something of abruptness, as if he could no longer bear to maintain
any further semblance of disguise. One could only infer from the
manner of his going that he passionately desired either solitude or
the sole companionship of those with whom he could speak plainly of
his distress.</p>
<p>We took our cue from him with an evident alacrity. Every one
looked as if he or she were saying something that began with a
half-apologetic &ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo;; and Mrs. Jervaise
interpreted our spirit when she remarked to the company in general,
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s very late, I&rsquo;m afraid, and I dare say
we&rsquo;ve all got a lot to do before we start for church. We
shall have to leave soon after half-past ten,&rdquo; she
explained.</p>
<p>Frank had already left the room when she said that, she herself
went out with her elder daughter, and the four of us who remained,
all visitors, were left to pair with each other as we chose. It was
Miss Tattersall who determined the arrangement. She cleverly
avoided the submissive glance of little Nora Bailey, and asked me
unequivocally if I would care to take a &ldquo;stroll&rdquo; with
her in the garden.</p>
<p>I agreed with a touch of eagerness and followed her, wondering
if her intriguing sentence before breakfast had been nothing more
than a clever piece of chicane, planned to entice me into a
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te.</p>
<p>(I admit that this may sound like a detestable symptom of vanity
on my part, but, indeed, I do not mean to imply that she cared a
snap of the fingers for me personally. She was one of those women
who must have some man in tow, and it happened that I was the only
one available for that week-end. Frank was supposed to be in love
with Miss Bailey; Gordon Hughes was engaged to some girl in the
north, and used that defence without shame when it suited him.)</p>
<p>I did not, however, permit Miss Tattersall to see my eagerness
when we were alone on the terrace together. If she was capable of
chicane, so was I; and I knew that if she had anything to tell me,
she would not be able to keep it to herself for long. If, on the
other hand, I began to ask questions, she would certainly take a
pleasure in tantalising me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about going to church?&rdquo; was my
opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;We all
go in solemn procession. We walk&mdash;for piety&rsquo;s
sake&mdash;it&rsquo;s over a mile across the fields&mdash;and we
are rounded up in lots of time, because it&rsquo;s a dreadful thing
to get there after the bell has stopped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interrupting the service,&rdquo; I put in with the usual
inanity that is essential to the maintenance of this kind of
conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than that,&rdquo; Miss Tattersall
explained gaily; &ldquo;because Mr. Sturton waits for the
Jervaises, to begin. When we&rsquo;re late we hold up the devotions
of the whole parish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; I commented; sincerely, this time; and
with a thought of my socialist friend Banks. I could still
sympathise with him on that score, even though I was now strongly
inclined to side with the Jervaises in the Brenda affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Miss Tattersall agreed.
&ldquo;Of course, they <em>are</em> the only important people in
the place,&rdquo; she added thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So important that it&rsquo;s slightly presumptuous to
worship God without the sanction of their presence in
church,&rdquo; I remarked. And then, feeling that this comment was
a trifle too strong for my company, I tried to cover it by changing
the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, do you think we <em>ought</em> to stay on here
over the week-end?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be more
tactful of us to invent excuses and leave them to
themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly it would. Have you only just thought of
it?&rdquo; Miss Tattersall said pertly. &ldquo;Nora and I agreed
about that before we came down to prayers. But there&rsquo;s a
difficulty that seems, for the moment, insuperable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is?&rdquo; I prompted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No conveyance,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;There
aren&rsquo;t any Sunday trains on the loop line, Hurley Junction is
fifteen miles away, and the Jervaises&rsquo; car is Heaven knows
where and the only other that is borrowable, Mr. Turnbull&rsquo;s,
is derelict just outside the Park gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought she was rather inclined to make a song of it all,
genuinely thankful to have so sound an excuse for staying to
witness the dramatic developments that might possibly be in store
for us. I do not deny that I appreciated her feeling in that
matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the horses?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too far for them, in the omnibus,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;And nothing else would be big enough for four people and
their luggage. But, as a matter of fact, Nora and I talked it all
over with Mrs. Jervaise before prayers, and she said we
weren&rsquo;t to think of going&mdash;especially as it was all
right, now, about Brenda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it is all right, if only for old
Jervaise&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; I said, craftily.</p>
<p>She looked up at me, trying to guess how far I was honest in
that remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t really believe&hellip;&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not,&rdquo; I returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Brenda <em>has</em> come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Jervaise said&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had to, of course,&rdquo; Miss Tattersall replied
curtly.</p>
<p>I pursed my mouth and shook my head. &ldquo;It would be too
risky to deceive us as crudely as that,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Make
it so much more significant if we discovered that they had been
lying about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Tattersall looked obstinate, putting on that wooden
enduring expression peculiar to fair people with pale eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she has come back,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>I continued to argue. I guessed that she had some piece of
evidence in reserve; also, that for some reason she was afraid to
produce it. And at last, as I had hoped, my foolish, specious
arguments and apparent credulity irritated her to a pitch of
exasperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you can talk till all&rsquo;s blue,&rdquo; she broke
in with a flash of temper, &ldquo;but she hasn&rsquo;t come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know she hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Miss Tattersall said, and
the pink of her cheeks spread to her forehead and neck like an
overflowing stain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course if you know&hellip;&rdquo; I conceded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she affirmed, still blushing.</p>
<p>I realised that the moment had come for conciliation.
&ldquo;This is tremendously interesting,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>She looked up at me with a question in her face, but I did not
understand until she spoke, that what had been keeping back her
confession was not doubt of my trustworthiness but her fear of
losing my good opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect you&rsquo;ll think it was horrid of me,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>I made inarticulate sounds intended to convey an effect of
reassurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <em>will</em>,&rdquo; she insisted, and gave her
protest a value that I felt to be slightly compromising. I could
only infer that the loss of my good opinion would be fatal to her
future happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I protested, although I
had to say it in a tone that practically confirmed this talk of
ours as a perfectly genuine flirtation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men have such queer ideas of honour in these
things,&rdquo; she went on with a recovering confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you&mdash;peeped,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Into Brenda&rsquo;s room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made a <em>moue</em> that I ought to have found fascinating,
nodding emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door wasn&rsquo;t locked, then?&rdquo; I put in.</p>
<p>She shook her head and blushed again; and I guessed in a flash
that she had used the keyhole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But could you be sure?&rdquo; I persisted.
&ldquo;Absolutely sure that she wasn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I only opened the door for a second,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;But I saw the bed. It hadn&rsquo;t been slept
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this happened?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just before I came down to prayers,&rdquo; she
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where is she?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>Miss Tattersall laughed. Now that we had left the dangerous
topic of her means of obtaining evidence, she was sure of herself
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might be anywhere by this time,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;She and her lover obviously went off in the motor together
at twelve o&rsquo;clock. They are probably in London, by
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not give her confidence for confidence. I had practically
promised Banks not to say that I had seen him on Jervaise Clump at
five o&rsquo;clock that morning, and I was not the least tempted to
reveal that important fact to Miss Tattersall. I diverted the angle
of our talk a trifle, at the same time allowing my companion to
assume that I agreed with her conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that the person
I&rsquo;m most sorry for in this affair is Mr. Jervaise. He seems
absolutely broken by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Tattersall nodded sympathetically. &ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t
it dreadful?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;At breakfast this morning I
was thinking how perfectly detestable it was of Brenda to do a
thing like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or of Banks?&rdquo; I added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it wasn&rsquo;t his fault,&rdquo; Miss Tattersall
said spitefully. &ldquo;He was just infatuated, poor fool. She
could do anything she liked with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reflected that Olive Jervaise and Nora Bailey would probably
have expressed a precisely similar opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s a weak sort of chap?&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; Miss Tattersall replied.
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look weak&mdash;not at all. No! he is just
infatuated&mdash;for the time being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had been pacing up and down the lawn, parallel to the front
of the house and perhaps fifty yards away from it&mdash;a safe
distance for maintaining the privacy of our conversation. And as we
came to the turn of our walk nearest to the drive, I looked back
towards the avenue that intervened between us and the swelling
contours of Jervaise Clump. I was thinking about my expedition
towards the sunrise; and I was taken completely off my guard when I
saw a tweed-clad figure emerge from under the elms and make its way
with a steady determination up the drive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one of them isn&rsquo;t in London, anyway,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Who?&rdquo; she returned, staring, and I realised
that she was too short-sighted to make out the identity of the
advancing figure from that distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she repeated with a hint of
testiness.</p>
<p>I had seen by then that I had inadvertently given myself away,
and I had not the wit to escape from the dilemma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said, hopelessly
embarrassed. &ldquo;It&mdash;it just struck me that this might be
Banks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had come nearer to us now, near enough for Miss Tattersall to
recognise him; and her amazement was certainly greater than
mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; she said with a little
catch in her breath. &ldquo;It is Banks, out of uniform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment I hoped that her surprise might cover my slip, but
she was much too acute to pass such a palpable blunder as that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;but how did you know?
I thought you had never seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just an intuition,&rdquo; I prevaricated and tried, I
knew at the time how uselessly, to boast a pride in my powers of
insight.</p>
<p>The effect upon my companion was neither that I hoped to
produce, nor that I more confidently expected. Instead of chaffing
me, pressing me for an explanation of the double game I had
presumably been playing, she looked at me with doubt and an obvious
loss of confidence. Just so, I thought, she might have looked at me
if I had tried to take some unfair advantage of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose it&rsquo;s time to get ready for
church,&rdquo; she remarked coldly. &ldquo;Are you
coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I forget what I replied. She was already slipping into the
background of my interest. I was so extraordinarily intrigued by
the sight of Arthur Banks, the chauffeur, boldly ringing at the
front door of Jervaise Hall.</p>

<h2>Notes and Queries</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Miss Tattersall had started for the house and her preparations
for church-going, but she paused on the hither side of the drive
and pretended an interest in the flower beds, until Banks had been
admitted to the Hall.</p>
<p>I could not, at that distance, mark the expression on
John&rsquo;s face when he answered the bell, but I noticed that
there was a perceptible interval of colloquy on the doorstep before
the strange visitor was allowed to enter. I should have liked to
hear that conversation, and to know what argument Banks used in
overcoming John&rsquo;s reluctance to carry the astounding message
that the chauffeur had &ldquo;called&rdquo; and wished to see Mr.
Jervaise. But, no doubt, John&rsquo;s diplomacy was equal to the
occasion. Banks&rsquo;s fine effort in self-assertion was probably
wasted. John would not mention the affront to the family&rsquo;s
prestige. He would imply that Banks had come in the manner proper
to his condition. &ldquo;Banks wishes to know if he might speak to
you a minute, sir,&rdquo; was all the warning poor old Jervaise
would get of this frontal attack upon his dignities.</p>
<p>So far I felt a certain faith in my ability to guess the hidden
action of the drama that was being played in the Hall; but beyond
this point my imagination would not carry me. I could not foresee
the attitude of either of the two protagonists. I thought over what
I remembered of my conversation with Banks on the hill, but the
only essential that stuck in my mind was that suggestion of the
&ldquo;pull,&rdquo; the admittedly unfair advantage that he might
possibly use as a last resource. I was conscious of an earnest wish
that that reserve would not be called upon. I felt, intuitively,
that it would shame both the chauffeur and his master. I had still
less material for any imaginative construction of old
Jervaise&rsquo;s part in the scene now being played; a scene that I
could only regard as being of the greatest moment. Indeed I
believed that the conversation then taking place would reach the
climax of the whole episode, and I bitterly regretted that I had
apparently no possible chance of ever learning the detail of that
confrontation of owner and servant. Worse still, I realised that I
might have some difficulty in gathering the upshot. Whether Banks
were accepted or rejected the Jervaises would not confide the story
to their visitors.</p>
<p>I must admit that my curiosity was immensely piqued; though I
flatter myself that my interest was quite legitimate, that it
contained no element of vulgar inquisitiveness. Nevertheless, I did
want to know&mdash;the outcome, at least&mdash;and I could decide
upon no intermediary who would give me just the information I
desired.</p>
<p>Miss Tattersall I ruled out at once. She so persistently
vulgarised the affair. I felt that in her mind she regarded the
elopement as subject for common gossip; also, that she was not free
from a form of generalised jealousy. She did not want Arthur Banks
for herself, but she evidently thought him a rather admirable
masculine figure and deplored his &ldquo;infatuation&rdquo; for
Brenda. Moreover, I had a notion that I had fallen from Miss
Tattersall&rsquo;s favour. There was something in her expression
when she discovered my deceit in pretending ignorance of the heroic
chauffeur that portrayed a sense of personal injury. No doubt she
thought that I had squeezed her confidence, while I treacherously
withheld my own; and she would certainly regret that confession of
having peeped into Brenda&rsquo;s room, even if she did not guess
that I had inferred the final shame of using the keyhole.
Subsequent evidence showed that my only mistake in this connection
was a fatuous underestimation of the lady&rsquo;s sense of
injury.</p>
<p>Of the other members of the house-party, Frank Jervaise was the
only one who seemed likely or able to post me in the progress of
the affair, and I felt considerable hesitation in approaching him.
I could not expect a return of that mood of weakness he had
exhibited the night before; and I had no intention of courting a
direct snub from him.</p>
<p>There remained Banks, himself, but I could not possibly have
questioned him, even if my sympathies had still been engaged on his
side.</p>
<p>And I must admit that as I paced the lawn in front of the house
my sympathies were very markedly with old Jervaise. It hurt me to
remember that look of apprehension he had worn at breakfast. I
wanted, almost passionately, to defend him from the possibly
heart-breaking consequences that might arise from no fault of his
own.</p>
<p>I was still pondering these feelings of compassion for my host,
when the church-party emerged from the front door of the Hall. If
my watch were right they were very late. Mr. Sturton and his
congregation would have to wait ten minutes or so in patient
expectation before they could begin their devotions. And I would
gladly have effaced myself if only to save the Jervaises the
vexation of a still further delay. But I was too near the line of
their approach. Any attempt at retreat would have been a positive
rudeness.</p>
<p>I was framing an apology for not accompanying them to church as
they came up&mdash;Mrs. Jervaise and her daughter leading, with
their three visitors in a bunch behind. But I was spared the
necessity to offer what would certainly have been a transparent and
foolish excuse for absenting myself from their religious
observances. Mrs. Jervaise pulled herself together as the party
approached me. She had had her head down even more than usual as
they came out of the Hall, as if she were determined to butt her
way through any further obstacles that might intervene between her
and her duty as a Christian. At sight of me, however, she obviously
stiffened. She almost held herself erect as she faced me; and her
hawk nose jerked up like the head of a pick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not coming with us, Mr. Melhuish?&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will excuse me,&rdquo; I replied with, I hope,
a proper air of courtesy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said stiffly, her nose still
balanced, as it were, in preparation to strike. Then she lowered
her head with the air of one who carefully replaces a weapon, and
mumbling something about being &ldquo;dreadfully late as it
was,&rdquo; continued her interrupted plunging into the resistances
that separated her from her goal. The others followed, as if they
were being trailed in her wake by invisible hawsers. None of them
took any notice of me&mdash;particularly Miss Tattersall, whose
failure to see me was a marked and positive act of omission.</p>
<p>I realised that I had been disapproved and snubbed, but I was
not at all distressed by the fact. I put it all down to my failure
in piety, begun with my absence from prayers and now accentuated by
my absence from church. Olive, Nora Bailey, and Hughes had, I
supposed, followed Mrs. Jervaise&rsquo;s lead in duty bound, and I
knew nearly enough why Miss Tattersall had cut me. I had no idea,
then, that I had come under suspicion of a far more serious offence
than that of a sectarian nonconformity. Indeed, I hardly gave the
matter a moment&rsquo;s attention. The composition of the
church-party had provided me with material for further speculation
concerning the subject that was absorbing all my interest. Why were
old Jervaise and his son also absent from the tale of those devoted
pilgrims? Was that interview in the Hall developing some crucial
situation, and had Frank been called in? One thing was certain:
Banks had not, as yet, come out. I had kept my eye on the front
door. I could not possibly have missed him.</p>
<p>And it was with the idea of seeing what inferences I could draw
from his general demeanour when he did come, rather than with any
thought of accosting him, that I maintained my thoughtful pacing up
and down the lawn on the garden side of the drive. I was relieved
by the knowledge that that party of church-goers were out of the
way. I had a feeling of freedom such as I used to have as a boy
when I had been permitted to stay at home, on some plea or another,
on a Sunday morning. I had a sense of enlargement and
opportunity.</p>
<hr />
<p>I must have been on that lawn for more than an hour, and my
thoughts had covered much ground that is not appropriate to this
narrative, when I was roused to a recognition of the fact that my
brief freedom was passing and that I was taking no advantage of any
opportunity it might afford me.</p>
<p>The thing that suddenly stirred me to a new activity was the
sound of the stable-clock striking twelve. Its horrible bell still
had the same note of intrusive artificiality that had vexed me on
the previous night, but it no longer thrilled me with any sense of
stage effect. It was merely a mechanical and inappropriate invasion
of that lovely Sunday morning.</p>
<p>There was a strange stimulation, however, in the deductions that
I drew from that portentous chiming, for my interest was at once
called to the fact that this was the first time that clock had
struck since I had been on the lawn. I could not conceivably have
missed its earlier efforts at the hours of ten and eleven. There
was an insistence about the beastly thing that demanded one&rsquo;s
attention. Had it, then, run down overnight and been recently
re-wound? And if so, by whom?</p>
<p>It may seem absurd that I should have made so much of the
inferences that followed my consideration of this problem, but the
truth is that my mind was so intensely occupied with one subject
that everything seemed to point to the participation of the
important Arthur Banks. At any other time I should not have
troubled about the clock; now, I looked to it for evidence. And
however ridiculous it may appear, I was influenced in my excited
search for clues by the fact that the clock had, after it was
re-wound, only struck the hour of twelve. The significance of that
deduction lay in the observation&mdash;my experience is,
admittedly, limited&mdash;that clocks which have run down must be
patiently made to re-toll the hours they have missed, or they will
pick up their last neglected reminders of the time at the point at
which they stopped. And from that I inferred an esoteric knowledge
of mechanics from that rewinder of the stable-clock who had got the
horrid contrivance correctly going again without imposing upon us
the misery of slowly working through an almost endless series of,
as it were, historical chimes. I agree that my premises were
faulty, far too lightly supported, but my mind leapt to the
deduction that the mechanic in this connection could be none other
than Banks. And granting that, the further inferences were,
undoubtedly, important. For as I saw them they pointed infallibly
to the conclusion that Banks had accepted once more the yoke of
servitude; that he had made his exit through the servants&rsquo;
quarters and had meekly taken up his tasks again with the winding
of the stable-clock.</p>
<p>(I may add that strangely enough the weak inference was correct,
and the well-grounded one fallacious. If you would interpret the
riddle of human motives, put no confidence in logic. The principles
of logic are founded on the psychology of Anyone. And Anyone is a
mechanical waxwork, an intellectual abstraction, a thing without a
soul or a sub-consciousness.)</p>
<p>Having taken the side of old Jervaise, I ought to have been
comforted by this conclusion, and I tried to persuade myself that
it indicated the only satisfactory termination to the brief drama
of the night. I attempted to see the affair as a slightly
ridiculous episode that had occupied exactly twelve hours and ended
with an inevitable bathos. I pictured the return of a disgraced and
penitent Brenda, and the temporary re-employment, as an antidote to
gossip, of the defeated Banks. They would be parted, of course. She
might be taken abroad, or to Scotland, and by the time she
returned, he would have been sent back to the country from which he
had been injudiciously recalled. Finally, old Jervaise would be
able to take up his life again with his old zest. I believed that
he was a man who took his pleasures with a certain gusto. He had
been quite gay at the dance before the coming of the scandal that
had temporarily upset his peace of mind.</p>
<p>All this imaginary restitution was perfectly reasonable. I could
&ldquo;see&rdquo; things happening just as I had thought them. The
only trouble was that I could find no personal satisfaction in the
consideration of the Jervaises&rsquo; restored happiness. I was
aware of a feeling of great disappointment for which I could not
account; and although I tried to persuade myself that this feeling
was due to the evaporation of the emotional interest of the moving
drama that had been playing, I found that explanation insufficient.
I was conscious of a loss that intimately concerned myself, the
loss of something to which I had been unconsciously looking
forward.</p>
<p>I came out of my reverie to find that I had wandered half round
the house, across the formal pleasance, and that I was now at the
door leading into the kitchen garden.</p>
<p>I hesitated a moment with a distinct sense of wrong-doing,
before I opened the door with the air of one who defies his own
conscience, and passed up the avenue between the gouty
espaliers&mdash;fine old veterans they were, and as I could see,
now, loaded with splendid fruit. The iron gates that led out into
the Park were locked, but a gardener&mdash;the head gardener, I
suppose&mdash;came out of one of the greenhouses close at hand, and
let me through.</p>
<p>I began to hurry, then. It was already twenty past twelve, and
lunch was at half-past one. Just what I proposed to do, or whom I
expected to see, at the Home Farm, I had no idea; but I was
suddenly determined to get there and back before lunch. The walk
would not take me more than a quarter of an hour each way, but, for
no reason that I could explain, the balance of half an hour or so
that remained to me appeared far too short. I remember that as I
walked through the wood, I persuaded myself that I wanted to see
Arthur Banks, who, according to my neat and convincing theory, had
taken up his work again and was, therefore, probably at the Hall.
But, as I have said, our impulses are never guided, and seldom
altered, by that form of reasoning known as logic.</p>
<hr />
<p>But I never reached the farm, and I forgot all about the
pretended motive of my excursion. For in two seconds I came to an
entirely new judgment on the whole problem of the Jervaise-Banks
intrigue, a judgment that had nothing in common with any earlier
turns of sympathy from one party to the other.</p>
<p>Such a little thing it was that temporarily turned me into a
disgusted misanthrope, nothing more than a sight of two people seen
for a moment in an arresting shock of outraged amazement before I
turned a disgusted back upon them and retreated moodily to the
Hall. But the sight was enough to throw the affair into a new
perspective, and beget in me a sense of contempt for all the actors
in that midsummer comedy. &ldquo;A plague on both your
houses,&rdquo; I muttered to myself, but I saw them no longer as
the antagonists of a romantic drama. I was suddenly influenced to a
mood of scorn. Jervaises and Banks alike seemed to me unworthy of
any admiration. The members of those families were just a crowd of
self-seeking creatures with no thought beyond their own petty
interests. The Jervaises were snobs upset by the threat to their
silly prestige. Brenda was a feather-headed madcap without a scrap
of consideration for any one but herself. Banks was an infatuated
fool, and the best I could hope for him was that he would realise
the fact before it was too late. Frank, confound and confound him,
was a coarse-minded sensualist. The thought of him drove me crazy
with impatience&hellip;.</p>
<p>And what on earth could have tempted Anne to let him kiss her,
if she had not been a crafty, worldly-minded schemer with an eye on
the glories of ruling at the Hall?</p>
<p>It is true that I did not actually see him kiss her. I turned
away too quickly. But the grouping left me in no doubt that if he
had not kissed her already, he was on the point of doing it. In any
case he had had his arm round her, and she had shown no signs of
resisting him.</p>

<h2>The Outcast</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>My first impression of the curious change in demeanour shown
towards me by the Jervaises and their friends at lunch was that it
had no existence outside my own recently embittered mind. I thought
that I was avoiding them, not that they were avoiding me. It was
not until I condescended to come down from my pinnacle of conscious
superiority that I realised my own disgrace.</p>
<p>My effort at conversation with Mrs. Jervaise was a mere act of
politeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you were rather late this
morning,&rdquo; I said. It was not, perhaps, a tactful remark, but
I could think of nothing else. All the church-party were stiff with
the slightly peevish righteousness of those who have fulfilled a
duty contrary to their real inclinations.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jervaise lifted her nose savagely. No doubt her head went
with it, but only the nose was important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very late, Mr. Melhuish,&rdquo; she said, stared at me as
if debating whether she would not instantly give me the coup de
grace, and then dipped again to the threat of the imaginary
doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sturton give you a good sermon?&rdquo; I continued,
still suffering from the delusion that I was graciously overlooking
their obvious inferiority to myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a very able man; very able,&rdquo; Mrs. Jervaise
said, this time without looking up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are lucky to have such a good man as vicar,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;Sometimes there is&mdash;well, a lack of sympathy
between the Vicarage and the Hall. I remember&mdash;the case
isn&rsquo;t quite parallel, of course, but the moral is much the
same&mdash;I remember a curate my father had
once&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, my story of that curate is thoroughly sound. It is full of
incident and humour and not at all derogatory to the prestige of
the church. I have been asked for it, more than once, by hostesses.
And though I am rather sick of it myself, I still fall back on it
in cases of such urgency as I judged the present one to be. I
thought that I had been lucky to get so easy an opening to produce
the anecdote with relevance, and I counted on it for a good five
minutes relief from the constraint of making polite
conversation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jervaise&rsquo;s response began to open my eyes to the
state of the new relations that now existed between myself and the
rest of the party. She did not even allow me to begin. She ignored
my opening entirely, and looking down the table towards her husband
said, &ldquo;Mr. Sturton preached from the tenth of Hebrews,
&lsquo;Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without
wavering.&rsquo; Quite a coincidence, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed? Yes, quite a coincidence,&rdquo; Mr. Jervaise
replied without enthusiasm. He did not look as cheerful as I had
anticipated, but he wore the air of a man who has had at least a
temporary reprieve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Olive and I were quite struck by it; weren&rsquo;t we,
dear?&rdquo; Mrs. Jervaise continued, dragging in her
daughter&rsquo;s evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was very odd,&rdquo; Olive agreed tepidly.</p>
<p>I never knew what the coincidence was, but I judge from Mrs.
Jervaise&rsquo;s insistence that it was something perfectly
futile.</p>
<p>I glanced across at Hughes, and guessed that he was not less
bored than I was myself, but when I caught his eye he looked
hastily away.</p>
<p>I was beginning to wonder what I had done, but I valiantly tried
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it possible that many cases of
apparent coincidences are probably due to telepathy?&rdquo; I said
genially, addressing the dangerous-looking profile of my
hostess.</p>
<p>She gave an impatient movement of her head that reminded me of a
parrot viciously digging out the kernel of a nut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; she said, pointedly
turned to Gordon Hughes, who was on her other side, and asked him
if he had played much tennis lately.</p>
<p>I looked round the table for help, but none of the party would
meet my eyes, avoiding my glance with a determination that could
not be mistaken. I might have suffered from some loathsome
deformity. Frank, alone, appeared unaware of my innocent appeal for
an explanation. He was bending gloomily over his plate, apparently
absorbed in his own thoughts&mdash;though how any man could be
gloomy after his recent experience it was beyond me to imagine.</p>
<p>My astonishment flamed into a feeling of acute annoyance. If any
one had spoken to me at that moment, I should have been
unforgivably rude. But no one had the least intention of speaking
to me, and I had just sense enough to restrain myself from
demanding an apology from the company at large. That was my natural
inclination. I had been insulted; outraged. I was the
Jervaises&rsquo; guest, and whatever they imagined that I had done,
they owed it to me and to themselves to treat me with a reasonable
courtesy.</p>
<p>It was a detestable situation, and I was completely floored by
it for the moment. We were not half-way through lunch, and I felt
that I could not endure to sit there for another twenty minutes,
avoided, proscribed, held fast in a pillory, a butt for the sneers
of any fool at the table. On the other hand, if I got up and
marched out of the room, I should be acknowledging my
defeat&mdash;and my guilt of whatever crime I was supposed to have
committed. If I ever wished to justify my perfect innocence, I
should forfeit my chances, at once, by accepting the snub I had
received. To do that would be to acknowledge my sense of
misbehaviour.</p>
<p>I leaned a little forward and glanced at Miss Tattersall who was
sitting just beyond Nora Bailey on my side of the table. And I saw
that my late confidante, the user of keyholes, was faintly smiling
to herself with an unmistakable air of malicious satisfaction.</p>
<p>I wished, then, that I had not looked. I was no longer quite so
conscious of outraged innocence. It is true that I was guiltless of
any real offence, but I saw that the charge of complicity with the
chauffeur&mdash;a charge that had certainly not lost in substance
or in its suggestion of perfidy by Miss Tattersall&rsquo;s
rendering&mdash;was one that I could not wholly refute. I was in
the position of a man charged with murder on good circumstantial
evidence; and my first furious indignation began to give way to a
detestable feeling of embarrassment, momentarily increased by the
necessity to sit in silence while the inane chatter of the luncheon
table swerved past me. If I had had one friend with whom I could
have talked, I might have been able to recover myself, but I defy
any one in my situation to maintain an effective part with no
active means of expression.</p>
<p>I glanced a trifle desperately at Olive Jervaise. I judged her
to be rather a colourless creature who would not have the spirit
openly to snub me. She was nearly opposite to me, between her
brother and Hughes, and well placed for an open attack if I could
once engage her attention. But when I came to consider an opening,
every reasonably appropriate topic seemed to have some dangerous
relation to the <em>affaire Brenda</em>. Any reference to the
dance, to the Sturtons, the place, the weather, suddenly assumed in
my mind the appearance of a subtle approach to the subject I most
wished to avoid. If I was, indeed, regarded in that house as a spy
in league with the enemy, the most innocent remark might be
construed into an attempt to obtain evidence.</p>
<p>I fancy, too, that I was subject to an influence other than the
heightened self-consciousness due to my awkward situation. I had
only just begun to realise that the absence of Brenda must be a
horribly insistent fact to her own family. She was so entirely
different from the rest of them. Her vivacity, her spirit must have
shown amidst the nervous respectability of this dull and fearful
household like the gleam of unexpected water in the blankness of a
desert. Her absence must have seemed to them a positive thing.
Probably every one at the table was thinking of her at that moment.
And the result of this combined thought was producing a
hallucination of Brenda in my mind, strong enough to hypnotise me.
In any case, her apparition stood at the end of every avenue of
conversation I could devise. I could think of no opening that did
not lead straight up to the subject of her absence.</p>
<p>And even while I was still pondering my problem (I had come to
such fantastic absurdities as contemplating an essay on the Chinese
gamut, rejecting it on the grounds that Brenda was the only
musician in the family), that awful lunch was abruptly closed by a
unanimous refusal of the last course. Perhaps the others were as
eager as I was to put an end to that ordeal; all of them, that is,
with the exception of the spiteful snake who was responsible for my
humiliation.</p>
<p>The family managed to get out of the room this time without
their usual procrastinating civilities. I went ahead of Frank and
Hughes. I intended to spend a lonely afternoon in thinking out some
plan for exposing the treachery of Grace Tattersall, but as I was
crossing the Hall, Frank Jervaise came up behind me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Melhuish,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>I looked. I did more than that; I confronted him. There is just
a suspicion of red in my hair, and on occasion the influence of it
is shown in my temper. It must have shown then, for Jervaise was
visibly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no damned good being so ratty,
Melhuish,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Jolly well your own fault,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s my own fault?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t talk here,&rdquo; he said uneasily.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down the avenue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had an impression that he was going to offer to fight me. I
certainly hoped that he would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I agreed.</p>
<p>But when he spoke again, I realised that it was as a lawyer and
not as a fighter. He had, indeed, been preparing a cautious
impeachment of me. We had reached the entrance to the avenue before
he began, and the cloister of its cool shade seemed a sufficiently
appropriate setting for his forensic diplomacy. Outside, in the
glare of the brilliant August sun, I should have flared out at him.
In the solemnity of that Gothic aisle, I found influences which
helped me to maintain a relative composure.</p>
<p>He posed his first question with an assumed indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you sleep in the house last
night?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>I took time to consider my answer; I was taken aback by his
knowledge of the fact he had disclosed. My first impulse was to
retort &ldquo;How do you know that I didn&rsquo;t sleep in the
house?&rdquo; but I was determined to be very cautious at the
outset of this cross-examination. Obviously he meant it to take the
form of a cross-examination. I was equally determined that I would
presently reverse the parts of counsel and witness&mdash;or was I
the prisoner giving evidence on my own behalf?</p>
<p>We must have gone another fifteen or twenty deliberate paces
before I replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer that question in a minute. I should
like to know first what grounds you have for stating that I
didn&rsquo;t sleep in the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;You admit that you
didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to conduct your conversation on the
principles of the court room,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the only thing
I can do is to adopt the same method.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ignored that. &ldquo;You admit that you didn&rsquo;t sleep in
the house?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit nothing until I know what the devil
you&rsquo;re driving at,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>He did not look at me. He was saving himself until he reached
the brow-beating stage. But I was watching him&mdash;we were
walking a yard or two apart&mdash;and I noted his expression of
simulated indifference and forbearance, as he condescendingly
admitted my claim to demand evidence for his preliminary
accusation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were very late coming down,&rdquo; he began and
paused, probably to tempt me into some ridicule of such a worthless
piece of testimony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were seen coming into the house after eight
o&rsquo;clock in the morning,&rdquo; he continued, paused again and
then, as I kept silence, added, &ldquo;In evening dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>It was not. He had kept the decisive accusation until the
end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your bed had not been slept in,&rdquo; he concluded
wearily, as if to say, &ldquo;My good idiot, why persist in this
damning assumption of innocence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been examining the servants, I see,&rdquo; I
remarked.</p>
<p>He was not to be drawn by such an ingenuous sneer as that.
&ldquo;The housekeeper told the mater when she came back from
church,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose the thing came up in some
arrangement of household affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; I agreed; &ldquo;but why did your
mother tell <em>you</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw at once that he meant to evade that question if possible.
For some reason Miss Tattersall was to be kept out of the case.
Possibly she had made terms to that effect. More probably, I
thought, Jervaise was a trifle ashamed of the source of his
evidence against me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! look here, Melhuish,&rdquo; he said, with a return to
his bullying manner. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only making things look
worse for yourself by all this beating about the bush. It&rsquo;s
evident that you didn&rsquo;t sleep in the house, and I want to
know why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is sleeping in the house a condition of your
hospitality?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in ordinary circumstances,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
the circumstances are not ordinary. I suppose you haven&rsquo;t
forgotten that something happened last night which very seriously
affects us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t, but I don&rsquo;t see what the deuce
it&rsquo;s got to do with me,&rdquo; I returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I; unless it&rsquo;s one of your idiotic, romantic
tricks,&rdquo; he retorted; &ldquo;but I have very good evidence,
all the same, that you were concerned in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! is that what you&rsquo;re accusing me of?&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Jervaise replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I can put your mind at rest,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I
am ready to swear by any oath you like that I had nothing whatever
to do with your sister&rsquo;s elopement, and that I
know&hellip;&rdquo; I was going to add &ldquo;nothing more about it
than you do yourself,&rdquo; but remembering my talk with Banks, I
decided that that was not perfectly true, and with the
layman&rsquo;s respect for the sanctity of an oath I concluded,
&ldquo;and that I know very little more about it than <em>you</em>
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that little bit more that is so
important,&rdquo; Jervaise commented sardonically.</p>
<p>After all, a legal training does count for something. I was not
his match in this kind of give and take, and I decided to throw
down my hand. I was not incriminating Banks. I knew nothing about
his movements of the night, and in that morning interview with old
Jervaise the most important admission of all must almost certainly
have been made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you have a right to know that,&rdquo; I began,
&ldquo;although I don&rsquo;t think you and your family had any
right whatever to be so damnably rude to me at lunch, on the mere
spiteful accusations of Miss Tattersall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Tattersall?&rdquo; Jervaise put in, with a very
decent imitation of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m going to be perfectly honest with
you,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you drop that burlesque
of the legal manner and be equally honest with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply dunno what you&rsquo;re driving at,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, answer the question you shirked just
now,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;Why did your mother rush to tell you
that I hadn&rsquo;t slept in the house last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mater&rsquo;s in an awful state of nerves,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Incidentally I had to admit to myself that I had not made
sufficient allowance for that indubitable fact, but I chose to
disregard it at the moment. I wanted to be sure of the treachery of
Grace Tattersall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You asked me not to beat about the bush, a minute
ago,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and now you&rsquo;re trying to dodge all
my questions with the most futile and palpable evasions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance?&rdquo; he replied calmly, with a cunning
that nearly trapped me. For when I tried to recall, as I thought I
could, a specific and convincing instance of his evasion, I
realised that to cite a case would only draw us into an irrelevant
bickering over side issues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your last three or four answers were all obvious
equivocations,&rdquo; I said, and raising my voice I went straight
on over his attempt to expostulate by adding, &ldquo;And if Mrs.
Jervaise&rsquo;s state of nerves is an excuse for her confiding in
<em>you</em>, it isn&rsquo;t, in my opinion, any excuse for her
confiding in Miss Tattersall and Nora Bailey and Hughes, and
setting them on to&mdash;ostracise me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! come,&rdquo; Jervaise protested, a little taken
aback. I had put him in a quandary, now. He had to choose between
an imputation on his mother&rsquo;s good taste, savoir faire,
breeding&mdash;and an admission of the rather shameful source of
the present accusation against me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, it&rsquo;s absolutely clear to me
that Grace Tattersall is at the bottom of all this,&rdquo; I
continued, to get this point settled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly
sure your mother would not have treated me as she did unless her
mind had been perverted in some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should she&mdash;Miss Tattersall&mdash;I mean she
seemed rather keen on you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can explain that,&rdquo; I interrupted him. &ldquo;She
wanted to gossip with me about the whole affair this morning, and
she made admissions that I suppose she was subsequently ashamed of.
And after that she discovered by an accident that I had met Banks,
and jumped to the totally false conclusion that I had been drawing
her out for my own disreputable purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you meet Banks?&rdquo; was Jervaise&rsquo;s
only comment on this explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you that,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I
told you that I meant to be perfectly honest with you, but I want
to know first if I&rsquo;m not right about Miss
Tattersall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has been a bit spiteful about you,&rdquo; he
admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; I replied by way of
finally confirming his admission. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you
exactly what happened last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made a fairly long story of it; so long that we reached the
lodge at the Park gates before I had finished, and turned back
again up the avenue. I was careful to be scrupulously truthful, but
I gave him no record of any conversation that I thought might,
however indirectly, inculpate Banks.</p>
<p>Jervaise did not once interrupt me, but I saw that he was
listening with all his attention, studying my statement as he might
have studied a complicated brief. And when I had done, he thrust
out his ugly underlip with an effect of sneering incredulity that I
found almost unendurably irritating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that you don&rsquo;t believe
me?&rdquo; I asked passionately.</p>
<p>We were just opposite the side road that I had taken the night
before, the road that led through the thickest part of the spinney
before it came out into the open within a quarter of a mile of
Jervaise Clump. And as if both our minds had been unconsciously
occupied with the same thought, the need for a still greater
privacy, we turned out of the avenue with an air of deliberate
intention and a marked increase of pace. It seemed as though this
secluded alley had, from the outset, been the secret destination of
our walk.</p>
<p>He did not reply to my challenging question for perhaps a couple
of minutes. We were walking quite quickly, now. Until the heat of
our rising anger could find some other expression, we had to seek
relief in physical action. I had no doubt that Jervaise in his own
more restrained way was as angry as I was myself. His sardonic
sneer had intensified until it took the shape of a fierce, brooding
anger.</p>
<p>We were out of sight of the junction of the side road with the
avenue, when he stopped suddenly and faced me. He had manifestly
gathered himself together for a great effort that was, as it were,
focussed in the malignant, dominating scowl of his forbidding face.
The restraint of his language added to the combined
effect&mdash;consciously studied, no doubt&mdash;of coarse and
brutal authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why did you spy on me this morning?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Why did you follow me up to the Home Farm, watch me while I
was talking to Miss Banks, and then slink away again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have two failings that would certainly have disqualified me if
I had ever attempted to adopt the legal profession. The first is a
tendency to blush violently on occasion. The second is to see and
to sympathise with my opponent&rsquo;s point of view. Both these
failings betrayed me now. The blush seemed to proclaim my guilt; my
sudden understanding of Jervaise&rsquo;s temper confirmed it.</p>
<p>For, indeed, I understood precisely at that moment how enraged
he must be against me. He, like Miss Tattersall, had been playing
an underhand game, though his was different in kind. He had been
seduced (my bitterness against Anne found satisfaction in laying
the blame at her door!) into betraying the interests of his own
family. <em>I</em> did not, in a sense, blame him for that; I had,
the night before, been more than a little inclined to honour him
for it; but I saw how, from the purely Jervaise point of view, his
love-making would appear as something little short of criminal. And
to be caught in the act, for I had caught him, however unwillingly,
must have been horribly humiliating for him. Little wonder that
coming home, hot and ashamed from his rendezvous, and being
confronted with all the tale of my duplicity, he had flamed into a
fury of resentment against me. I understood that beyond any
question. Only one point still puzzled me. How had he been able
until this moment to restrain his fury? I could but suppose that
there was something cold-blooded, calculating, almost reptilian in
his character; that he had planned cautiously and far-sightedly
what he regarded as the best means for bringing about my ultimate
disgrace.</p>
<p>And now my blush and my powers of sympathy had betrayed me. I
felt like a convicted criminal as I said feebly, &ldquo;Oh! that
was an accident, absolutely an accident, I assure you. I had no
sort of idea where you were when I went up to the Home
Farm&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After keeping an eye on the front of the house all the
morning,&rdquo; he put in viciously.</p>
<p>A sense of awful frustration overcame me. Looking back on the
past fifteen hours, I saw all my actions ranged in a long
incriminating series. Each one separately might be explained, but
regarded as a consequent series, those entirely inconsequent doings
of mine could bear but one explanation: I was for some purpose of
my own, whether idiotically romantic or not, on the side of Banks
and Brenda. I had never lifted a finger to help them; I was not in
their confidence; and since the early morning I had withdrawn a
measure of my sympathy from them. But I could not prove any of
these things. I could only affirm them, and this domineering bully,
who stood glowering at me, wanted proof or nothing. He was too well
accustomed to the methods of criminals to accept explanations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe me?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Candidly, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>And at that my temper finally blazed. I could not bear any
longer either that awful sense of frustration or the sight of Frank
Jervaise&rsquo;s absurdly portentous scowl.</p>
<p>I did not clench my fists, but I presume my purpose showed
suddenly in my face, for he moved quickly backwards with a queer,
nervous jerk of the head that was the precise counterpart of the
parrot-like twist his mother had given at the luncheon table. It
was an odd movement, at once timid and vicious, and in an instant I
saw the spirit of Frank Jervaise revealed to me. He was a coward,
hiding his weakness under that coarse mask of the brooding,
relentless hawk. He had winced and retreated at my unspoken threat,
as he had winced at the thought of his thrashing at school. He had
taken his punishment stoically enough then, and might take another
with equal fortitude now; though he had been weakened in the past
five or six years by the immunity his frowning face had won for
him. But he could not meet the promise of a thrashing. I saw that
he would do anything, make any admission, to avoid that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Melhuish&hellip;&rdquo; he began, but I cut
him short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! go to hell,&rdquo; I said savagely.</p>
<p>I was disappointed. I wanted to fight him. I knew now that since
the scene I had witnessed in the wood the primitive savage in me
had been longing for some excuse to break out in its own primitive,
savage way. And once again I was frustrated. I was just too
civilised to leap at him without further excuse.</p>
<p>He gave me none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to take that tone&hellip;&rdquo; he
said with a ridiculous affectation of bravado, and did not complete
his sentence. His evasion was, perhaps, the best that he could have
managed in the circumstances. It was so obvious that only the least
further incentive was required to make me an irresponsible madman.
And he dared not risk it.</p>
<p>He turned away with a pretence of dignity, the craven brag of a
schoolboy who says, &ldquo;I could lick you if I wanted to, but I
don&rsquo;t happen to want to.&rdquo; I watched him as he walked
back towards the avenue with a deliberation that was so artificial,
I could swear that when he reached the turn he would break into a
run.</p>
<p>I stood still in the same place long after he was out of sight.
As my short-lived passion evaporated, I began to realise that I was
really in a very awkward situation. I could not and would not
return to the Hall. I had offended Frank Jervaise beyond all hope
of reconciliation. He would never forgive me for that exposure of
his cowardice. And if I had not had a single friend at the house
before, I could, after the new report of my treachery had been
spread by Frank, expect nothing but the bitterness of open enemies.
No doubt they would essay a kind of frigid politeness, their social
standards would enforce some show of outward courtesy to a guest.
But I simply could not face the atmosphere of the Hall again. And
here I was without my luggage, without even a hat, and with no idea
where I could find refuge. The only idea I had was that of walking
fifteen miles to Hurley Junction on the chance of getting a train
back to town.</p>
<p>It was an uncommonly queer situation for a perfectly innocent
man, week-ending at a country house. I should have been ashamed to
face the critics if I had made so improbable a situation the crux
of a play. But the improbability of life constantly outruns the
mechanical inventions of the playwright and the novelist. Where
life, with all its extravagances, fails, is in its refusal to
provide the apt and timely coincidence that shall solve the problem
of the hero. As I walked on slowly towards Jervaise Clump, I had
little hope of finding the peculiarly appropriate vehicle that
would convey me to Hurley Junction; and I did not relish the
thought of that fifteen mile walk, without a hat.</p>
<p>I kept to the road, skirting the pudding basin hill, and came
presently to the fence of the Park and to what was evidently a side
gate&mdash;not an imposing wrought-iron erection between stone
pillars such as that which announced the front entrance, but just a
rather high-class six-barred gate.</p>
<p>I hesitated a minute or two, with the feelings of one who leaves
the safety of the home enclosure for the unknown perils of the
wild, and then with a sigh of resignation walked boldly out on to
the high road.</p>
<p>I had no notion in which direction Hurley Junction lay, but luck
was with me, so far. There was a fourth road, opposite the Park
gate, and a sign-post stood at the junction of what may once have
been the main cross-roads&mdash;before some old Jervaise
land-robber pushed the park out on this side until he was stopped
by the King&rsquo;s highway.</p>
<p>On the sign-post I read the indication that Hurley Junction was
distant 14-1/2 miles, and that my direction was towards the north;
but I felt a marked disinclination to begin my walk.</p>
<p>It was very hot, and the flies were a horrible nuisance. I stood
under the shadow of the hedge, flapped a petulant handkerchief at
the detestably annoying flies, and stared down the road towards the
far, invisible distances of Hurley. No one was in sight. The whole
country was plunged in the deep slumber of a Sunday afternoon, and
I began to feel uncommonly sleepy myself. I had, after all, only
slept for a couple of hours or so that morning.</p>
<p>I yawned wearily and my thoughts ran to the refrain of
&ldquo;fourteen and a half miles; fourteen and a half miles to
Hurley Junction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well,&rdquo; I said to myself at last. &ldquo;I
suppose it&rsquo;s got to be done,&rdquo; and I stepped out into
the road, and very lazily and wearily began my awful tramp. The
road ran uphill, in a long curve encircling the base of the hill,
and I suppose I took about ten minutes to reach the crest of the
rise. I stayed there a moment to wipe my forehead and slap
peevishly at my accompanying swarm of flies. And it was from there
I discovered that I had stumbled upon another property of the
Jervaise comedy. Their car&mdash;I instantly concluded that it was
their car&mdash;stood just beyond the rise, drawn in on to the
grass at the side of the road, and partly covered with a
tarpaulin&mdash;it looked, I thought, like a dissipated roysterer
asleep in the ditch.</p>
<p>I decided, then, without the least compunction, that this should
be my heaven-sent means of reaching the railway. The Jervaises owed
me that; and I could leave the car at some hotel at Hurley and send
the Jervaises a telegram. I began to compose that telegram in my
mind as I threw off the tarpaulin preparatory to starting the car.
But Providence was only laughing at me. The car was there and the
tank was full of petrol, but neither the electric starter nor the
crank that I found under the seat would produce anything but the
most depressing and uninspired clanking from the mechanism that
should have responded with the warm, encouraging thud of renewed
life.</p>
<p>I swore bitterly (I can drive, but I&rsquo;m no expert), climbed
into the tonneau, pulled back the tarpaulin over me like a tent to
exclude those pestilent flies, and settled myself down to draw one
or two deep and penetrating inductions.</p>
<p>My first was that Banks had brought the car here the night
before with the fixed intention of abducting Brenda Jervaise.</p>
<p>My second was that the confounded fellow had cautiously removed
some essential part of the car&rsquo;s mechanism.</p>
<p>My third, that he would have to come back and fetch the car
sometime, and that I would then blackmail him into driving me to
Hurley Junction.</p>
<p>I did not trouble to draw a fourth induction. I was cool and
comfortable under the shadow of the cover. The flies, although
there were many openings for them, did not favour the darkness of
my tent. I leaned well back into the corner of the car and joined
the remainder of the county in a calm and restful sleep.</p>
<h3 class="title"><a name="Ch_IX" id="Ch_IX"></a>IX</h3>
<h2>Banks</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>I was awakened by the sound of footsteps on the
road&mdash;probably the first footsteps that had passed during the
hour and a half that I had been asleep. I was still lazily
wondering whether it was worth while to look out, when the
tarpaulin was smartly drawn off the car and revealed me to the eyes
of the car&rsquo;s guardian, Arthur Banks.</p>
<p>His first expression was merely one of surprise. He looked as
startled as if he had found any other unlikely thing asleep in the
car. Then I saw his surprise give way to suspicion. His whole
attitude stiffened, and I was given an opportunity to note that he
was one of those men who grow cool and turn pale when they are
angry.</p>
<p>My first remark to him was ill-chosen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Probably my last thought before I went to sleep had concerned
the hope that Banks would be the first person I should see when I
woke; and that thought now came up and delivered itself almost
without my knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have put you in charge, I suppose,&rdquo; he
returned grimly. &ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t have worried.
I&rsquo;d just come to take the car back to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had again been taken for a spy, but this time I was not
stirred to righteous indignation. The thing had become absurd. I
had for all intents and purposes been turned out of Jervaise Hall
for aiding and abetting Banks, and now he believed me to be a sort
of prize crew put aboard the discovered motor by the enemy.</p>
<p>My situation had its pathetic side. I had, by running away,
finally branded myself in the Jervaises&rsquo; eyes as a mean and
despicable traitor to my own order; and now it appeared that I was
not to be afforded even the satisfaction of having proved loyal to
the party of the Home Farm. I was a pariah, the suspect of both
sides, the ill-treated hero of a romantic novel. I ought to have
wept, but instead of that I laughed.</p>
<p>Perhaps I was still a little dazed by sleep, for I was under the
impression that any kind of explanation would be quite hopeless,
and I had, then, no intention of offering any. All I wanted was to
be taken to Hurley Junction; to get back to town and forget the
Jervaises&rsquo; existence.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo;s change of expression when I laughed began to
enlighten my fuddled understanding. I realised that I had no longer
to deal with a suspicious, wooden-headed lawyer, but with a frank,
kindly human being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the joke,&rdquo; he said, but his look
of cold anger was fading rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The joke,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is a particularly funny
one. I have quarrelled with the entire Jervaise family and their
house-party. I have been openly accused by Frank Jervaise of having
come to Thorp-Jervaise solely to aid you in your elopement; and my
duplicity being discovered I hastened to run away, leaving all my
baggage behind, in the fear of being stood up against a wall and
shot at sight. I set out, I may add, to walk fourteen miles to
Hurley Junction, but on the way I discovered this car, from which
you seem to have extracted some vital organ. So I settled myself
down to wait until you should return with its heart, or lungs, or
whatever it is you removed. And now, my dear chap, I beseech you to
put the confounded thing right again and drive me to Hurley.
I&rsquo;ve suffered much on your account. It&rsquo;s really the
least you can do by way of return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared at me in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, honestly, no kid&hellip;&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>I saw that, naturally enough, he could not make head or tail of
my story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s all perfectly true, in effect,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go into details. As a matter of fact,
all the Jervaises&rsquo; suspicions came about as a result of our
accidental meeting on the hill last night. I said nothing about it
to them, you understand; and then they found out that I
hadn&rsquo;t slept in the house, and Miss Tattersall discovered by
accident that I knew you by sight&mdash;that was when you came up
to the house this morning&mdash;and after that everything
I&rsquo;ve ever done since infancy has somehow gone to prove that
my single ambition in life has always been to help you in abducting
Brenda Jervaise. Also, I wanted to fight Frank Jervaise an hour or
two ago in the avenue. So, my dear Banks, have pity on me and help
me to get back to London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banks grinned. &ldquo;No getting back to London to-night,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Last train went at 3.19.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t there some hotel in the
neighbourhood?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He hesitated, imaginatively searching the county for some hotel
worthy of receiving me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing decent nearer than Godbury,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Twenty-three miles. There&rsquo;s an inn at Hurley
of a sort. There&rsquo;s no town there to speak of, you know.
It&rsquo;s only a junction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, I&rsquo;ll risk the inn at Hurley for one
night,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about your things?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blast!&rdquo; was my only comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rummest go I ever heard of,&rdquo; Banks interjected
thoughtfully. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean as they&rsquo;ve actually
<em>turned you out?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, not exactly,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;But I
couldn&rsquo;t possibly go back there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about writing a note for your things?&rdquo; he
suggested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d take it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ask them to lend me the motor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect they&rsquo;d mind,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. Anything to get rid of me,&rdquo; I
returned. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going to ask them any favours. I
don&rsquo;t mind using the bally thing&mdash;they owe me
that&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not going to ask them for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been a fair old bust up,&rdquo; he commented,
evidently curious still about my quarrel at the Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you that it ended with my wanting to fight Frank
Jervaise,&rdquo; I reminded him.</p>
<p>He grinned again. &ldquo;How did he get out of it?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think he wanted to get out of it?&rdquo; I
retorted.</p>
<p>He measured me for a moment with his eye before he said,
&ldquo;Mr. Frank isn&rsquo;t the fighting sort. I&rsquo;ve seen him
go white before now, when I&rsquo;ve took the corner a bit
sharp.&rdquo; He paused a moment before adding, &ldquo;But
they&rsquo;re all a bit like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nervous at dangerous corners,&rdquo; I commented,
sharpening his image for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blue with funk,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that possibly some hint of the family taint in
Brenda had influenced, at the last moment, the plan of her proposed
elopement; but I said nothing of that to Banks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better leave my things,&rdquo; I said,
returning to the subject which was of chief importance to me. You
take me to that inn at Hurley. If I arrive in a motor,
they&rsquo;ll take me in all right, even though I haven&rsquo;t any
luggage. I&rsquo;ll invent some story as we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d take you <em>in</em>,&rdquo; Banks replied
thoughtfully. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t hardly more than a public
house, really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought that some strain of the gentleman&rsquo;s servant in
him was concerned with the question of the entertainment proper to
my station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only for one night,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes,&rdquo; he said, obviously thinking of something
else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too far for you to go?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He glanced at his wrist watch. &ldquo;Quarter past five,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d take me the best part of two hours to
get there and back&mdash;the road&rsquo;s none too good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to go?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, honestly I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;The fact is I want to see Mr. Jervaise again.&rdquo; He
smiled as he added, &ldquo;My little affair isn&rsquo;t settled yet
by a good bit, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sheered away from that topic; chiefly, I think, because I
wanted to avoid any suggestion of pumping him. When you have
recently been branded as a spy, you go about for the next few days
trying not to feel like one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there any place in the village I could go
to?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one pub&mdash;a sort of
beerhouse&mdash;but they don&rsquo;t take people in,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No lodgings?&rdquo; I persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jervaises don&rsquo;t encourage that sort of
thing,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Afraid of the place getting
frippery. I&rsquo;ve heard them talking about it in the car. And as
they own every blessed cottage in the place&hellip;.&rdquo; He left
the deduction to my imagination, and continued with the least touch
of bashfulness, &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t care to come to us, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Home Farm?&rdquo; I replied stupidly. I was
absurdly embarrassed. If I had not chanced to see that grouping in
the wood before lunch, I should have jumped at the offer. But I
knew that it must have been Miss Banks who had seen
me&mdash;spying. Jervaise had had his back to me. And she would
probably, I thought, take his view of the confounded accident. She
would be as anxious to avoid me as I was to avoid her. Coming so
unexpectedly, this invitation to the Farm appeared to me as a
perfectly impossible suggestion.</p>
<p>Banks, naturally, misinterpreted my embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it would put you in the wrong, as it
were&mdash;up at the Hall,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Coming to us
after that row, I mean, &rsquo;d look as if what they&rsquo;d been
saying was all true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a hang about <em>that</em>,&rdquo; I
said earnestly. In my relief at being able to speak candidly I
forgot that I was committing myself to an explanation; and Banks
inevitably wandered into still more shameful misconceptions of my
implied refusal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a farm, of course&hellip;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my dear chap,&rdquo; I interposed quickly. &ldquo;Do
believe me, I&rsquo;d far sooner stay at the Home Farm than at
Jervaise Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me with rather a blank stare of inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then?&rdquo; was all he found to say.</p>
<p>I could think of nothing whatever.</p>
<p>For a second or two we stared at one another like antagonists
searching for an unexposed weakness. He was the first to try
another opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact is, I suppose,&rdquo; he said tentatively,
&ldquo;that you&rsquo;d like to be out of this affair altogether?
Had enough of it, no doubt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I might have accepted that suggestion without hurting
Banks&rsquo;s self-respect. I saw the excuse as a possibility that
provided an honourable way of escape. I had but to say,
&ldquo;Well, in a way, yes. I have, in all innocence, got most
confoundedly entangled in an affair that hasn&rsquo;t anything
whatever to do with me, and it seems that the best thing I can do
now is to clear out.&rdquo; He would have believed that. He would
have seen the justice of it. But the moment this easy way of escape
was made clear to me, I knew that I did not want to take it; that
in spite of everything, I wanted, almost passionately, to go to the
Home Farm.</p>
<p>I was aware of a sudden clarity of vision. The choice that lay
before me appeared suddenly vital; a climax in my career, a symbol
of the essential choice that would determine my future.</p>
<p>On the one hand was the security of refusal. I could return,
unaffected, to my familiar life. Presently, when the Jervaise
nerves had become normal again, the Jervaises themselves would
recognise the egregious blunder they had made in their treatment of
me. They would apologise&mdash;through Frank. And I should go on,
as I had begun. I was already decently successful. I should become
more successful. I could look forward to increased financial
security, to a measure of fame, to all that is said to make life
worth living. And as I saw it, then, the whole prospect of that
easy future, appeared to me as hopelessly boring, worthless,
futile.</p>
<p>On the other hand&hellip;? I had no idea what awaited me on the
other hand. I could see that I should have to accept the stigma
that had been put upon me; that I should be thrown into the company
of a young woman whose personality had extraordinarily attracted
me, who probably detested me, and who might now be engaged to a man
I very actively disliked; that I should involve myself in an affair
that had not fully engaged my sympathy (I still retained my feeling
of compassion for old Jervaise); that I should, in short, be
choosing the path of greatest resistance and unpleasantness, with
no possibility of getting any return other than scorn and
disgrace.</p>
<p>I saw these alternatives in a flash, and no sane man would have
hesitated between them for one moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here, Banks,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What would
your mother and&mdash;and your sister say to having an unknown
visitor foisted upon them without notice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;d be all right,&rdquo; he said with
conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing I should like better than to stay
with you,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;if I thought that
your&mdash;people would care to have me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as a matter of fact,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my
father and mother haven&rsquo;t come home yet. They drove over to
some relations of ours about twelve miles away, yesterday
afternoon, and they won&rsquo;t be back till about seven, probably.
Last chance my father had before harvest, and my mother likes to
get away now and again when she can manage it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know yet, then, about you
and&hellip;?&rdquo; I said, momentarily diverted by the new aspect
this news put on the doings of the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. That&rsquo;ll be all right, though,&rdquo; Banks
replied, and added as an afterthought, &ldquo;The old man may be a
bit upset. I want to persuade &rsquo;em all to come out to Canada,
you see. There&rsquo;s a chance there. Mother would come like a
shot, but I&rsquo;m afraid the old man&rsquo;ll be a bit
difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, then, look here, Banks,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You
won&rsquo;t want a stranger up there to-night of all
nights&mdash;interfering with your&mdash;er&mdash;family
council.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banks scratched his head with a professional air. &ldquo;I
dunno,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It might help.&rdquo; He looked at me
reflectively before adding, &ldquo;You know She&rsquo;s up
there&mdash;of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Was she there
last night when Jervaise and I went up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;We meant to go off together and chance
it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;May as well tell you now. There&rsquo;s
no secret about it among ourselves. And then she came out to me on
the hill without her things&mdash;just in a cloak. Came to tell me
it was all off. Said she wouldn&rsquo;t go, that way&hellip;. Well,
we talked&hellip;. Best part of three hours. And the end of it was,
she came back to the Farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it isn&rsquo;t all off?&rdquo; I put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The elopement is,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not the proposed marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned against the door of the car with the air of one who is
preparing for a long story. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you want to
hear all this?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sure&mdash;that is, if you want to tell me,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;And if I&rsquo;m coming home with you, it might be
as well if I knew exactly how things stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt somehow as if you and me were going to hit it off,
last night,&rdquo; he remarked shyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; I rejoined, not less shy than he
was.</p>
<p>Our friendship had been admitted and confirmed. No further word
was needed. We understood each other. I felt warmed and comforted.
It was good to be once more in the confidence of a fellowman. I
have not the stuff in me that is needed to make a good spy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the way things are at present,&rdquo; Banks hurried
on to cover our lapse into an un-British sentimentality, &ldquo;is
like this. We&rsquo;d meant, as I told you, to run
away&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then she was afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was rather the other way round. It was me that was
afraid. You see, I thought I should take all the blame off the old
man by going off with her&mdash;him being away and all, I
didn&rsquo;t think as even the Jervaises could very well blame it
on to him, overlooking what she pointed out, as once we&rsquo;d
gone they&rsquo;d simply have to get rid of him, too, blame or no
blame. They&rsquo;d never stand having him and mother and Anne
within a mile of the Hall, as sort of relations. <em>I</em> ought
to have seen that, but one forgets these things at the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what it came to,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;was that
we might as well face it out as not. She&rsquo;s like
that&mdash;likes to have things straight and honest. So do I, for
the matter of that; but once you&rsquo;ve been a gentleman&rsquo;s
servant it gets in your blood or something. I was three years as
groom and so on up at the Hall before I went to Canada. Should have
been there now if it hadn&rsquo;t been for mother. I was only a lad
of sixteen when I went into service, you see, and when I came back
I got into the old habits again. I tell you it&rsquo;s difficult
once you&rsquo;ve been in service to get out o&rsquo; the way of
feeling that, well, old Jervaise, for instance, is a sort of little
lord god almighty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can understand that,&rdquo; I agreed, and added,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m rather sorry for him, old Jervaise. He has
been badly cut up, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banks looked at me sharply, with one of his keen, rather
challenging turns of expression. &ldquo;Sorry for him? You
needn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I could tell you
something&mdash;at least, I can&rsquo;t&mdash;but you can take it
from me that you needn&rsquo;t waste your pity on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I realised that this was another reference to that
&ldquo;pull&rdquo; I had heard of, which could not be used, and was
not even to be spoken of to me after I had been admitted to
Banks&rsquo;s confidence. I realised, further, that my guessing
must have gone hopelessly astray. Here was the suggestion of
something far more sinister than a playing on the old man&rsquo;s
affection for his youngest child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll take it from you,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;On the other hand, you can take it from me that old Jervaise
is very much upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banks smiled grimly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s nervous at dangerous
corners, like you said,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;However, we
needn&rsquo;t go into that&mdash;the point is as I began to tell
you, that we&rsquo;ve decided to face it out; and well, you saw me
go up to the Hall this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Banks said. &ldquo;I saw the old man and
Mr. Frank, and they were both polite in a sort of way&mdash;no
shouting nor anything, though, of course, Mr. Frank tried to
browbeat me&mdash;but very firm that nothing had got to happen; no
engagement or running away or anything. She was to come home and I
was to go back to Canada&mdash;they&rsquo;d pay my fare and so
on&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? I just stuck to it we were going to get married, and
Mr. Frank tried to threaten me till the old man stopped him, and
then I came out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you wind up the stable-clock?&rdquo; I put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I forgot it last night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I
hate to see a thing not working properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dear Banks! I did not know, then, how characteristic that was of
him.</p>
<p>I returned to the subject in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you propose to do, then?&rdquo; I asked.
&ldquo;To get their consent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just stick to it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think they&rsquo;ll give way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to, in the end,&rdquo; he affirmed
gravely, and continued in a colder voice that with him indicated a
flash of temper. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just their respectability they
care about, that&rsquo;s all. If they were fond of her, or she of
them, it would be another thing altogether. But she&rsquo;s
different to all the others, and they&rsquo;ve never hit it off,
she and them, among themselves. Why, they treat her quite
differently to the others; to Miss Olive, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they?&rdquo; I said, in astonishment. I had been
romantically picturing Brenda as the favourite child, and I could
not, at once, see her in this new light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She never got on with &rsquo;em, somehow,&rdquo; Banks
said. &ldquo;Anyway, not when they were alone. Always rows of one
sort or another. They couldn&rsquo;t understand her, of course,
being so different to the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was not satisfied with this explanation, but I did not press
him for further details. His insistence on Brenda&rsquo;s
difference from the rest of the Jervaises was evidently as far as
he could get. The difference was obvious enough, certainly, but he
would naturally exaggerate it. He was, as Miss Tattersall had said,
&ldquo;infatuated,&rdquo; but I put a more kindly construction on
the description than she had done&mdash;perhaps
&ldquo;enthralled&rdquo; would have been a better word.</p>
<p>We had come to a pause. His confidences were exhausted for the
present. He had told me all that it was necessary for me to know
before I met Brenda and his sister; and I waited for him, now, to
renew his invitation. I preferred that <em>he</em> should re-open
that subject; but he came to it rather obliquely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Might as well be getting
on, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded and got out of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you find your way up?&rdquo; he proceeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only about half a mile,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t miss it. You see, I want to get the car back
to the house. Don&rsquo;t do it any good standing about here.
Besides, it wouldn&rsquo;t do for them to think as I was holding it
over them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even the picture of a herculean Banks holding that car over the
Jervaises failed to divert me, just then. I was too much occupied
with my new friend&rsquo;s simple absence of tact. I would sooner
have faced a return to the Hall than an unsupported appearance at
the Farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m not going up there alone,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>Banks was honestly surprised. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;You met Anne last night, didn&rsquo;t you? That&rsquo;ll be
all right. You tell her I told you to come up.
<em>She&rsquo;ll</em> understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take you long to run up
to the Hall and put the car in,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
cut across the Park and meet you in that wood just below your
house&mdash;the way that Jervaise and I went last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked distressed. He could not understand my unwillingness
to go alone, but his sense of what was due to me would not permit
him to let me wait for him in the wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, I can&rsquo;t see&hellip;&rdquo; he began, and then
apparently realising that he was failing either in respect or in
hospitality, he continued, &ldquo;Oh! well, I&rsquo;ll just run up
with you at once; it won&rsquo;t take us ten minutes, and half an
hour one way or the other won&rsquo;t make any
difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I accepted his sacrifice without further protestation; and after
he had carefully replaced the tarpaulin over the tonneau of the
car, we set off briskly towards the Farm. About a third of a mile
farther on we left the highroad for a side road, and another three
or four minutes&rsquo; walk up the hill brought us to the main
entrance to the Farm. I saw, now, that I had come with Jervaise to
a side door last night. This front approach was more
imposing&mdash;up a drive through an avenue of limes. The house
seen from this aspect looked very sweet and charming. It was
obviously of a date not later than the sixteenth century, and I
guessed that the rough-cast probably concealed a half-timber work
structure. In front of it was a good strip of carefully kept lawn
and flower garden. The whole place had an air of dignity and beauty
that I had not expected, and I think Banks must have noticed my
surprise, for he said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad, is it? Used to be a kind of dower house once
upon a time, they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely charming,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Now, this
is the sort of house I should like to live in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say it&rsquo;ll be to let before long,&rdquo;
Banks said with a touch of grim humour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to me, though,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>He laughed. &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<p>We had paused at the end of the little avenue for me to take in
the effect of the house, and as we still stood there, the sound of
a man&rsquo;s voice came to us through the open window of one of
the rooms on the ground floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s home sooner than you expected,&rdquo;
I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the old man,&rdquo; Banks said in a tone
that instantly diverted my gaze from the beauties of the Home
Farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it, then?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he said. He was suddenly keen, alert and
suspicious. I saw him no longer as the gentleman&rsquo;s servant,
the product of the Jervaise estate, but as the man who had knocked
about the world, who often preferred to sleep in the open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two of them there,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Frank
Jervaise and that young fellow Turnbull, if I&rsquo;m not
mistaken.&rdquo; And even as he spoke he began hurriedly to cross
the little lawn with a look of cold anger and determination that I
was glad was not directed against myself.</p>
<p>As I followed him, it came into my mind to wonder whether Frank
Jervaise had taken me with him as a protection the night before?
Had he been afraid of meeting Banks? I had hitherto failed to find
any convincing reason for Jervaise&rsquo;s queer mark of confidence
in me.</p>
<h3 class="title"><a name="Ch_X" id="Ch_X"></a>X</h3>
<h2>The Home Farm</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>I must own that I was distinctly uncomfortable as I followed
Banks into the same room in which I had sat on my previous visit to
the Home Farm. The influence of tradition and habit would not let
me alone. I cared nothing for the Jervaises&rsquo; opinion, but I
resented the unfairness of it and had all the innocent man&rsquo;s
longing to prove his innocence&mdash;a feat that was now become for
ever impossible. By accepting Banks&rsquo;s invitation, I had
confirmed the worst suspicions the Jervaises could possibly have
harboured against me.</p>
<p>Indeed, it seems probable that I was now revealing more shameful
depths of duplicity than their most depraved imaginings had been
able to picture. As I entered the room, I looked first at Frank,
and his dominant emotion, just then, appeared to be surprise. For a
moment I had a sense of reprieve. I guessed that he had not been
truly convinced of the truth of his own accusations against me. But
any relief I may have felt was dissipated at once. I saw
Jervaise&rsquo;s look of surprise give place to a kind of perplexed
anger, an expression that I could only read as conveying his
amazement that any gentleman (I am sure his thought was playing
about that word) could be such a blackguard as I was now proving
myself to be.</p>
<p>Ronnie Turnbull, also, evidently shared that opinion. The boyish
and rather theatrical movement with which he turned his back upon
me, showed at once that he had been coached in the suspicions that
were now so finally clinched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fellow simply isn&rsquo;t worth speaking to,&rdquo;
was the inarticulate message of his gesture.</p>
<p>And certainly I gave neither of them any occasion to speak to
me. Banks&rsquo;s opening plunged us into one of those chaotic
dialogues which are only made more confused by any additional
contribution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you come up here for?&rdquo; Banks asked,
displaying his immediate determination to treat the invaders
without respect of class on this common ground of his
father&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our affair,&rdquo; Frank snapped. He looked
nervously vicious, I thought, like a timid-minded dog turned
desperate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil do you mean?&rdquo; Turnbull asked at the
same moment, and Brenda got up from her chair and tried to address
some explanation to her lover through the ominous preparatory
snarlings of the mel&eacute;e.</p>
<p>I heard her say, &ldquo;Arthur! They&rsquo;ve been trying
to&hellip;&rdquo; but lost the rest in the general shindy.</p>
<p>Turnbull, by virtue of his lung-power, was the most audible of
the four.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve jolly well got to understand, my good
man,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;that the sooner you get out of
this the better&rdquo;; and went on with more foolishness about
Banks having stolen the motor&mdash;all painfully tactless stuff,
if he still had the least intention of influencing Brenda, but he
was young and arrogant and not at all clever.</p>
<p>Banks and Jervaise were sparring at each other all the time that
Turnbull fulminated, and Brenda&rsquo;s soprano came in like a
flageolet obbligato&mdash;a word or two here and there ringing out
with a grateful clearness above the masculine accompaniment.</p>
<p>I dared, in the confusion, to glance at Anne, and she looked up
at me at the same moment. She was slightly withdrawn from the
tumult that drew together about the counter of the sturdy oak table
in the centre of the room. She was sitting in the towering old
settle by the fireplace, leaning a little forward as if she awaited
her opportunity to spring in and determine the tumult when
something of this grotesque male violence had been exhausted.</p>
<p>She looked at me, I thought, with just a touch of supplication,
a look that I misinterpreted as a request to use my influence in
stopping this din of angry voices that was so obviously serving no
useful purpose. But I felt no inclination to respond to that appeal
of hers. I had an idea that she might be going to announce her
engagement to Jervaise, an announcement that would critically
affect the whole situation; and I had no wish to help her in
solving the immediate problem by those means.</p>
<p>Perhaps she read in my face something of the sullen resentment I
was feeling, for she leaned back quickly into the corner of the
settle, with a movement that seemed to indicate a temporary
resignation to the inevitable. I saw her as taking cover from this
foolish masculine din about the table; but I had no doubt that she
was still awaiting her opportunity.</p>
<p>It was Jervaise who brought back the unintelligible disputants
to reasonable speech. He stopped speaking, stepped back on to the
hearth-rug, and then addressed the loudly vociferous Turnbull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ronnie!&rdquo; Jervaise said in a tone that arrested
attention, and having got his man&rsquo;s ear, added, &ldquo;Half a
minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here, you know,&rdquo; Turnbull protested, still
on the same note of aggressive violence. &ldquo;What I mean to say
is that this feller seems to confoundedly well
imagine&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do for God&rsquo;s sake <em>shut up!</em>&rdquo; Jervaise
returned with a scowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you think that I haven&rsquo;t any
right&hellip;&rdquo; Turnbull began in a rather lower voice; and
Brenda at last finding a chance to make herself heard, finished him
by saying quickly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly you haven&rsquo;t; no right whatever to come
here&mdash;and <em>brawl</em>&hellip;&rdquo; She spoke
breathlessly, as though she were searching in the brief interlude
of an exhausting struggle for some insult that would fatally wound
and offend him. She tried to show him in a sentence that he was
nothing more to her than a blundering, inessential fool,
interfering in important business that was no concern of his. And
although the hurry of her mind did not permit her to find the
deadly phrase she desired, the sharpness of her anxiety to wound
him was clear enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! of course, if you think that&hellip;&rdquo; he said,
paused as if seeking for some threat of retaliation, and then flung
himself, the picture of dudgeon, into a chair by the wall. He
turned his back towards Brenda and glared steadfastly at his rival.
I received the impression that the poor deluded boy was trying to
revenge himself on Brenda. At the back of his mind he seemed still
to regard her escapade as a foolish piece of bravado, undertaken
chiefly to torture himself. His attitude was meant to convey that
the joke had gone far enough, and that he would not stand much more
of it.</p>
<p>For a time at least he was, fortunately, out of the piece.
Perhaps he thought the influence of his attitude must presently
take effect; that Brenda, whom he so habitually adored with his
eyes, would be intimidated by his threat of being finally
offended?</p>
<p>The three other protagonists took no more notice of the sulky
Ronnie, but they could not at once recover any approach to
sequence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know why you&rsquo;ve come up here,&rdquo;
Banks persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point,&rdquo; Jervaise began in a
tone that I thought was meant to be conciliatory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is&mdash;partly,&rdquo; Brenda put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear girl, do let&rsquo;s have the thing clear,&rdquo;
her brother returned, but she diverted his apparent intention of
making a plain statement by an impatient,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s all <em>clear</em> enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t, by any means,&rdquo; Jervaise
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To us it is,&rdquo; Banks added, meaning, I presume, that
he and Brenda had no doubts as to their intentions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to persist in the claim you made this
morning?&rdquo; Jervaise asked.</p>
<p>Banks smiled and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Frank,&rdquo; Brenda interpreted.
&ldquo;You must know that we can&rsquo;t do anything
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s foolish to say you
<em>can&rsquo;t</em>,&rdquo; he returned irritably, &ldquo;when so
obviously you <em>can</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, we&rsquo;re going to,&rdquo; Banks affirmed
with a slight inconsequence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you purpose to stay on here?&rdquo; Jervaise said
sharply, as if he were posing an insuperable objection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not likely,&rdquo; Banks replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
going to Canada, the whole lot of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father and mother, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if I can persuade &rsquo;em; and I can,&rdquo; Banks
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t tried yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they know anything about this? Anything, I
mean, before last night&rsquo;s affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically nothing at all,&rdquo; Banks said. &ldquo;Of
course, nothing whatever about last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you honestly think&hellip;&rdquo; began Jervaise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be all right, won&rsquo;t it, Anne?&rdquo;
Banks replied.</p>
<p>But Anne, still leaning back in the corner of the settle,
refused to answer.</p>
<p>Jervaise turned and looked down at her. &ldquo;If you all
went&hellip;?&rdquo; he said, giving his incomplete sentence the
sound of a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I should certainly go, too,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>Jervaise frowned moodily. I could see that he was caught in an
awkward dilemma, but I was not absolutely sure as to the form it
took. Had Anne made conditions? Her remark seemed, I thought, to
hint a particular stipulation. Had she tried to coerce him with the
threat of accompanying her brother to Canada unless the engagement
to Brenda was openly sanctioned by the family?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must see how impossible it is,&rdquo; Jervaise
said, still looking at Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We</em> don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Brenda put
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; her brother returned
savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Brenda replied.</p>
<p>Jervaise snorted impatiently, but he had enough control of
himself to avoid the snare of being drawn into a bickering
match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as if the decision rested with me,&rdquo;
he went on, looking down at the hearth-rug, but still, I fancy,
addressing himself almost exclusively to Anne. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
make my father and mother see things as you do. No one could. Why
can&rsquo;t you compromise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! <em>How</em>?&rdquo; Brenda broke out with a fierce
contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agree to separate&mdash;for a time,&rdquo; Jervaise said.
&ldquo;Let Banks go to Canada and start a farm or something, and
afterwards you could join him without any open scandal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any mortal thing to save a scandal, of course,&rdquo;
Brenda commented scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would <em>you</em> be prepared to do that?&rdquo;
Jervaise asked, turning to Banks.</p>
<p>I thought Banks seemed a trifle irresolute, as though the bribe
of finally possessing Brenda was tempting enough to outweigh any
other consideration. But he looked at her before replying, and her
contemptuous shake of the head was completely decisive. He could
not question any determination of hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here, Brenda, why&hellip;&rdquo; Jervaise began
on a note of desperate reasonableness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m going out <em>with</em> him,&rdquo;
Brenda said. They might have chased that argument round for half an
hour if Ronnie had not once more interposed.</p>
<p>His dudgeon had been slowly giving place to a shocked surprise.
It was being borne in upon his reluctant mind that Brenda and Banks
honestly intended to get married. And here was Frank Jervaise, for
some mistaken purpose of his own, calmly admitting the possibility
of the outrage, instead of scorning the bare idea of it with
violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re making a ghastly mistake,
Frank,&rdquo; he said with a composure that was intended to be
extremely ominous.</p>
<p>Jervaise clutched at the interruption, probably to give himself
a little more time. The women were proving so unamenable to his
excellent reasoning. One simply contradicted him, and the other
refused to speak. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a mistake, Ronnie?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listening to them at all,&rdquo; Turnbull said, with a
preposterous attempt to be dignified. He would not look at Brenda
as he continued, but he was certainly aware that she had turned
towards him when he spoke, and the consciousness that she was
watching him steadily increased his embarrassment.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly absurd, I mean, to talk as if you and
your people would allow the thing to go on&mdash;under any
circumstances&mdash;perfect rot! Why can&rsquo;t you say at once
that it&rsquo;s got to stop&mdash;absolutely, and&mdash;Good
Lord!&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care what any one thinks&mdash;if I were
in your place I&rsquo;d jolly well sling Banks off the
premises&mdash;I tell you I would&mdash;&rdquo; he got to his feet,
his vehemence was increasing, as if he would shout down
Brenda&rsquo;s silent disdain&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d confoundedly
well kick him out of the county&hellip;&rdquo; He looked almost
equal to the task as he stood there roaring like a young bull-calf;
but although he could have given his rival a good three stone in
weight there was, I fancy, a difference in the quality of their
muscles that might have left the final advantage with Banks in a
rough-and-tumble engagement.</p>
<p>But despite, or perhaps on account of his complete ineptitude, I
had a feeling of sympathy for Turnbull. It must have been very
exasperating for him to stand there, roaring out his sincerest
convictions and to be received by every one of us with a forbearing
contempt.</p>
<p>Even Brenda expressed something of pity for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Ronnie, don&rsquo;t be absolutely idiotic,&rdquo;
she said, forbearingly, but rather as though she warned him that he
had said quite enough.</p>
<p>He breathed heavily, resentfully, but still declined to look at
her. &ldquo;Of course if you&rsquo;d sooner I went away
altogether&hellip;&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that you can help us by staying,&rdquo;
Brenda said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean for good,&rdquo; he explained tragically.</p>
<p>I heard afterwards that he had been in love with Brenda since
she was nine years old, but I might have inferred the fact from his
present attitude. He simply could not believe, as yet, that she
would let him go&mdash;for good, as he said. No doubt she had
tricked and plagued him so often in the past that the present
situation seemed to him nothing more than the repetition of a
familiar experience.</p>
<p>Brenda must have realised that, too; but, no doubt, she shrank
from wounding him mortally in public. The ten years of familiar
intercourse between her and Ronnie were not to be obliterated in a
day, not even by the fury of her passion for Arthur Banks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But you <em>are</em>
interrupting, Ronnie. Do go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave you here?&rdquo; He was suddenly encouraged
again by her tone. He looked down at her, now; pleading like a
great puppy, beseeching her to put a stop to this very painful
game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, Ronnie, you must realise that I&mdash;mean it,
this time,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that you&rsquo;re going to &hellip; going to
Canada,&rdquo; he begged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes. Definitely and absolutely finally yes,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With&mdash;him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, <em>Brenda</em>!&rdquo; The long-drawn appeal of her
name showed that the full bitterness of the truth was coming home
to him at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said, and the sound of it was
in some way painfully final.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t because&hellip;&rdquo; he began, but she
anticipated his well-known reasons by saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to do with you or with anything
you&rsquo;ve done, nothing whatever. I&rsquo;m sorry, Ronnie, but
it&rsquo;s fate&mdash;just fate. Do go, now. I&rsquo;ll see you
again before&mdash;before we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And still he stood for an instant undecided; and I could see the
struggle that was going on in him, between the influence of Harrow
and Oxford and those of the honest, simple primitive man. He knew
that the right, conventional thing for him to do was to be
magnanimous; to admit that he was the defeated lover, and to say
something that would prove how splendid he could be in the moment
of disaster. The traditions of Harrow, Oxford, and the melodrama
united to give him an indication of the proper conduct of the
situation, and against them was ranged nothing more than one feral
impulse to take Banks by the throat and settle his blasphemous
assumption of rivalry off-hand.</p>
<p>But it was, I think, a third influence that decided the struggle
for that time. His glare of wrath at Banks had been followed by one
last yearning look at Brenda, and some sentimental realisation of
his loss rose and choked him, temporarily superseding the powers
both of make-believe and instinct. One lesson he had learnt at
Harrow and Oxford so thoroughly that he re-acted to it even in this
supreme crisis of his life. He might give expression to brutal
passion, but in no circumstances whatever must he break down and
weep in public.</p>
<p>He turned quickly and blundered out of the room with a stumbling
eagerness to be alone that was extraordinarily pathetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll admit, B., that it&rsquo;s cursedly hard
lines on Ronnie after all these years,&rdquo; Frank said with what
sounded like genuine emotion.</p>
<p>She took that up at once. &ldquo;I know it is,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be hard lines on lots of people, but
there&rsquo;s no way out of it. You may think it&rsquo;s silly tosh
to talk about Fate; but it <em>is</em> Fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she looked at Banks with something in her expression
that was surely enough to compensate him for any pain or sacrifice
he might have to endure for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We</em> can&rsquo;t help it, can we, Arthur?&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>He was too moved to answer. He set his lips tightly together and
shook his head, gazing at her with a look of adoration and
confidence that was almost violent in its protestation of love.</p>
<p>Jervaise turned round and leaned his forehead against the high
mantelpiece. I looked out of the window. Anne remained hidden in
the corner of the settle. We all, no doubt, had the same feeling
that this love-affair was showing itself as something too splendid
to be interfered with. Whether or not it had the qualities that
make for endurance, it had a present force that dwarfed every other
emotion. Those two lovers ruled us by their perfect devotion to
each other. I felt ashamed of my presence there, as if I had
intruded upon some fervent religious ceremony. They were both so
sincere, so gallant, and so proud.</p>
<p>It was Banks who re-started the conversation. The solitude we
had permitted to the lovers was at once too little and too much for
them. What had passed between them by an exchange of signals in the
brief interval, I could only guess; they certainly had not spoken,
but Banks&rsquo;s new subject suggested that they had somehow
agreed to divert the interest momentarily from themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought Mr. Melhuish back with me,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to stay the night with us.&rdquo; He
may have been addressing Brenda in answer to some look of inquiry
that had indicated my resolutely unconscious back.</p>
<p>Since Turnbull had gone, I was more than ever the outsider and
intruder, and I was all too keenly aware of that fact as I turned
back towards the room. My embarrassment was not relieved by the
slightly perplexed astonishment the announcement had evoked in the
faces of the two women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought you were staying at the Hall,&rdquo; Brenda
said, looking at me with that air of suspicion to which I was
rapidly growing accustomed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but for reasons that your
brother may be able to explain, I&rsquo;m staying there no
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at Jervaise, then, but he had no reply ready. I had
put him in a difficult position. I had a chance to revenge myself
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand, Frank,&rdquo; Brenda prompted
him; and Anne began to come to life for the first time since I had
entered the room&mdash;there was a new effect of mischief about
her, as if she had partly guessed the cause of my expulsion from
the Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; Jervaise
prevaricated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But one that I think you ought to tell,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;in justice to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found that Melhuish had been, most unwarrantably,
interfering in&mdash;in this affair of yours, B.,&rdquo; he
grumbled; &ldquo;and, in any case, it&rsquo;s no business of
his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brenda&rsquo;s dark eyebrows lifted with that expression of
surprised questioning to which she could give such unusual effect.
I suppose it emphasised that queer contrast&mdash;unique in my
experience&mdash;between her naturally fair hair, and her black
eyebrows and eyelashes. I have to emphasise the fact that the straw
gold of her abundant vital hair was its <em>natural</em> colour.
She had often, I believe, threatened to dye it, in order to avoid
the charge of having already done so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What piffle!&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;How has Mr.
Melhuish interfered? Why, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen
him since last night at the dance. Besides,&rdquo; she glanced at
me with a half-whimsical touch of apology, &ldquo;I hardly know
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s some romantic rot of his, I
suppose,&rdquo; Jervaise returned sullenly. &ldquo;I never thought
it was serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Anne interposed, &ldquo;it sounds very
serious&hellip;if Mr. Melhuish has had to leave the Hall in the
middle of his visit&mdash;and come to us.&rdquo; I inferred that
she was deliberately overlooking my presence in the room for some
purpose of her own. She certainly spoke as if I were not
present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly a misunderstanding,&rdquo; Jervaise said.
&ldquo;No reason why he shouldn&rsquo;t come back with me now if he
wants to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would in that case explain, of course, how the
misunderstanding arose?&rdquo; I put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> don&rsquo;t know what your game is,&rdquo; he
returned allusively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never had one,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looked infernally suspicious,&rdquo; was his grudging
answer.</p>
<p>The two girls exchanged a look of understanding, but I had no
notion what they intended by it. I had not learnt, then, how
cleverly they played up to each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but suspicious of what, Mr. Jervaise?&rdquo; Anne
said, taking up the cross-examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spying upon us,&rdquo; Jervaise growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon you or me?&rdquo; asked Brenda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both,&rdquo; Jervaise said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; asked Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord knows,&rdquo; Jervaise replied.</p>
<p>I made no effort to interrupt them. The two girls were clearing
my character for me by the simple obvious method that I had not had
the wit to adopt for myself. I might have argued and protested for
hours, and the only result would have been to confirm
Jervaise&rsquo;s suspicions. Confronted by an innocent demand for
explanation, he had not a leg to stand on.</p>
<p>Brenda&rsquo;s eyebrows went up again, with that slightly
bizarre, exotic air which was so arresting. She spoke to me this
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you mean to say that they were all so horrid to
you that you had to come away?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely that,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t tell us what Mr. Melhuish has
<em>done!</em>&rdquo; Anne persisted, continuing her
cross-examination of Jervaise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for one thing, he went out to meet your brother at
three o&rsquo;clock this morning,&rdquo; he replied grudgingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t come out to meet me,&rdquo; Banks put in.
&ldquo;We did meet all right, but it was the first time we&rsquo;d
ever seen each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all four looked at Jervaise, awaiting his next piece of
evidence with the expectant air of children watching a
conjurer.</p>
<p>He began to lose his temper. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see that this
has got anything to do with what we&rsquo;re
discussing&hellip;&rdquo; he said, but I had no intention of
letting him off too easily. He had saved me the trouble of making
tedious explanations, and my character had been cleared before Anne
and Brenda, which two things were all that I really cared about in
this connection; but I wanted, for other reasons, to make Jervaise
appear foolish. So I interrupted him by saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better tell them about Miss
Tattersall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned on me, quite savagely. &ldquo;What the devil has this
affair of ours got to do with you, Melhuish?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing whatever,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You dragged me
into it in the first instance by bringing me up here last night,
but since then I haven&rsquo;t interfered one way or the other.
What does affect me, however, is that you and your family
have&mdash;well&mdash;insulted me, and for that you do owe me, at
least, an explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you come up here, now?&rdquo; he asked with
that glowering legal air of his; thrusting the question at me as if
I must, now, be finally confuted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After you ran away from me in the avenue,&rdquo; I said
promptly, &ldquo;it seemed that the only thing left for me to do
was to walk to Hurley Junction; but a quarter of a mile from the
Park gate I found your car drawn up by the side of the road. And as
I had no sort of inclination to walk fourteen miles on a broiling
afternoon, I decided to wait by the car until some one came to
fetch it. And when presently Banks came, I tried my best to
persuade him to take me to the station in it. He refused on the
grounds that he wanted to take the car back at once to the garage;
but when I explained my difficulty to him, his hospitable mind
prompted him to offer me temporary refuge at the Home Farm. He
brought me back to introduce me, and we found you here. Simple,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jervaise scowled at the hearth-rug. &ldquo;All been a cursed
misunderstanding from first to last,&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what was that about Grace Tattersall?&rdquo; Brenda
asked. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d accused <em>her</em> of spying, I
could have understood it. She was trying to pump me for all she was
worth yesterday afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve admitted that there must have been some
misunderstanding,&rdquo; Jervaise said. &ldquo;For goodness&rsquo;
sake, let&rsquo;s drop this question of Melhuish&rsquo;s
interference and settle the more important one of what we&rsquo;re
going to do about&mdash;you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I resent that word &lsquo;interference,&rsquo;&rdquo; I
put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! resent it, then,&rdquo; Jervaise snarled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, I think Mr. Melhuish is perfectly
justified,&rdquo; Brenda said. &ldquo;I feel horribly ashamed of
the way you&rsquo;ve been treating him at home. I should never have
thought that the mater&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand that she&rsquo;s nearly off
her head with worrying about you?&rdquo; Jervaise interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Brenda returned. &ldquo;If it
had been Olive, I could. But I should have thought they would all
have been jolly glad to see the last of me. They&rsquo;ve always
given me that impression, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in this way,&rdquo; her brother grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that exactly?&rdquo; Anne asked with
a great seriousness.</p>
<p>I think Jervaise was beginning to lose his nerve. He was
balanced so dangerously between the anxiety to maintain the
respectability of the Jervaises and his passion, or whatever it
was, for Anne. Such, at least, was my inference; although how he
could possibly reconcile his two devotions I could not imagine,
unless his intentions with regard to Anne were frankly shameful.
And Jervaise must, indeed, be an even grosser fool than I supposed
him to be if he could believe for one instant that Anne was the
sort of woman who would stoop to a common intrigue with him. For it
could be nothing more than that. If they loved each other, they
could do no less than follow the shining example of Brenda and
Anne&rsquo;s brother. I could see Anne doing that, and with a still
more daring spirit than the other couple had so far displayed. I
could not see her as Frank Jervaise&rsquo;s mistress. Moreover, I
could not believe now, even after that morning&rsquo;s scene in the
wood, that she really cared for him. If she did, she must have been
an actress of genius, since, so far as I had been able to observe,
her attitude towards him during the last half-hour had most nearly
approached one of slightly amused contempt.</p>
<p>Jervaise&rsquo;s evident perplexity was notably aggravated by
Anne&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, naturally, my father and mother don&rsquo;t want an
open scandal,&rdquo; he said irritably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why a scandal?&rdquo; asked Anne. &ldquo;If Arthur
and Brenda were married and went to Canada?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that <em>I</em> think it would be a
scandal,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only telling you the way
that <em>they&rsquo;d</em> certainly see it. It might have been
different if your brother had never been in our service. You must
see that. <em>We</em> know, of course, but other people
don&rsquo;t, and we shall never be able to explain to them. People
like the Turnbulls and the Atkinsons and all that lot will say that
Brenda eloped with the chauffeur. It&rsquo;s no good beating about
the bush&mdash;that&rsquo;s the plain fact we&rsquo;ve got to
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, hadn&rsquo;t we better face it?&rdquo; Anne
returned with a flash of indignation. &ldquo;Or do you think you
can persuade Arthur to go back to Canada, alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jervaise grunted uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know it&rsquo;s no earthly, Frank,&rdquo; Brenda
said. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you be a sport and go back and tell
them that they might as well give in at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my dear girl, you must know perfectly well that
they&rsquo;ll <em>never</em> give in,&rdquo; her brother
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jervaise might,&rdquo; Banks put in.</p>
<p>Frank turned to him sharply. &ldquo;What do you mean by
that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d have given in this morning, if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for you,&rdquo; Banks said, staring with his most dogged
expression at Jervaise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo; Jervaise retaliated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What he said, and the way he behaved,&rdquo; Banks
asserted, the English yeoman stock in him still very apparent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken,&rdquo; Jervaise snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a chance to prove it, then,&rdquo; was
Banks&rsquo;s counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to take that car back. Give me a chance
for another talk with Mr. Jervaise; alone this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at Banks with a sudden feeling of anxiety. I was afraid
that he meant at last to use that &ldquo;pull&rdquo; he had hinted
at on the hill; and I had an intuitive shrinking from the idea of
his doing that. This open defiance was fine and upright. The other
attitude suggested to my mind the conception of something cowardly,
a little base and underhand. He looked, I admit, the picture of
sturdy virtue as he stood there challenging his late master to
permit this test of old Jervaise&rsquo;s attitude, but the prize at
stake was so inestimably precious to Banks, that it must have
altered all his values. He would, I am sure, have committed murder
for Brenda&mdash;any sort of murder.</p>
<p>Frank Jervaise did not respond at once to the gage that had been
offered. He appeared to be moodily weighing the probabilities
before he decided his policy. And Brenda impatiently prompted him
by saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see what possible objection you can
have to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only want to save the pater any worry I can,&rdquo;
Jervaise said. &ldquo;He has been more cut up than any one over
this business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pater has?&rdquo; queried Brenda on a note of
amazement. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have expected him to be half as
bad as the mater and Olive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he is. He&rsquo;s worse&mdash;much worse,&rdquo;
Jervaise asserted.</p>
<p>I was listening to the others, but I was watching Banks, and I
saw him sneer when that assertion was made. The expression seemed
to have been forced out of him against his will; just a quick jerk
downwards of the corners of his mouth that portrayed a supreme
contempt for old Jervaise&rsquo;s distress. But that sneer revealed
Banks&rsquo;s opinion to me better than anything he had said or
done. I knew then that he was aware of something concerning the
master of the Hall that was probably unknown either to Brenda or
Frank, something that Banks had loyally hidden even from his
sister. He covered his sneer so quickly that I believe no one else
noticed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, surely, it would be better for the pater to see
Arthur and have done with it,&rdquo; Brenda was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I dare say,&rdquo; Jervaise agreed with his usual air
of grudging the least concession. &ldquo;Are you ready to go
now?&rdquo; he asked, addressing Banks.</p>
<p>Banks nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pick up the car on the
way,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you&mdash;as far as the car,&rdquo;
Brenda said, and the pair of them went out together.</p>
<p>Jervaise stretched himself with a self-conscious air. &ldquo;It
will take him the best part of an hour getting the car into the
garage and all that,&rdquo; he remarked, looking at me.</p>
<p>I could see, of course, that he wanted me to go; his hint had
been, indeed, almost indecently pointed; and I had no wish to
intrude myself upon them, if Anne&rsquo;s desire coincided with
his. I got to my feet and stood like an awkward dummy trying to
frame some excuse for leaving the room. I could think of nothing
that was not absurdly obvious. I was on the point of trying to save
the last remnant of my dignity by walking out, when Anne relieved
my embarrassment. I knew that she had been watching me, but I was
afraid to look at her. I cannot say why, exactly, but I felt that
if I looked at her just then I should give myself away before
Jervaise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go and see about Mr. Melhuish&rsquo;s room,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>She was half-way to the door when Jervaise stopped her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should rather like to speak to you for a minute
first,&rdquo; he remarked, and scowled again at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more to be said until Arthur has
seen Mr. Jervaise,&rdquo; Anne replied, as though any subject other
than the affair Brenda, could not conceivably be of interest to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t about them,&rdquo; Jervaise said
awkwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it, then?&rdquo; Anne asked. I dared to look at
her, now, and her face was perfectly serious as she added,
&ldquo;Was it about the milk, or eggs, or anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without doubt there was a delicious strain of minx in her!</p>
<p>Jervaise lost his temper. I believe that if I had offered to
fight him, then, he would have welcomed the opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you know what I want to say,&rdquo; he snorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not say it?&rdquo; Anne replied.</p>
<p>He turned savagely upon me. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got the
common sense&hellip;&rdquo; he began, but Anne cut him short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we don&rsquo;t suspect <em>our</em> guests of
spying,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>I was nearly sorry for Jervaise at that moment. He could not
have looked any more vindictive than he looked already, but he
positively trembled with anger. He could not endure to be thwarted.
Nevertheless, he displayed a certain measure of self-control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said as calmly as he could.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to take that tone&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Anne prompted him. She showed no sign of
being in any way disconcerted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will hardly help your brother,&rdquo; he
concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made a mistake in trying to help him this
morning,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t make the same
mistake twice in one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He evidently knew what she meant, although I did not. His heavy
eyebrows twitched, and then, with a half-contemptuous shrug of his
shoulders he strode out of the room with an air of leaving us to
the doom we so justly deserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst of it is that the second mistake doesn&rsquo;t
cancel the first,&rdquo; Anne remarked thoughtfully.</p>

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>She still stood by the great oak table, her hands resting
lightly on its dark polished surface. I could see the vague
reflection of her fingers reaching up through the deep solidity of
the oak to join hands with her. She produced, I thought, an
impressive effect of fragility and power in her contrast with that
massive table. The material of her flesh was so delicate compared
to the inert, formidable mass before her. She could not have lifted
or moved it by her own effort. And yet it seemed that she had
absolute command over that ponderous obstacle, that in some way the
mobility of her spirit must give her control of it, that she might,
if she wished, plunge those relatively fragile hands of hers deep
into the lake of that dark and adamant surface.</p>
<p>She had not looked at me since Jervaise left the room, and when
she spoke again she gazed with a kind of concentrated abstraction
out of the window at the quiet glory of the calm August evening.
Nevertheless her speech showed that all her attention was being
given to the human interests that had just been absorbing us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you really a friend of ours?&rdquo; she asked,
&ldquo;or did you just come here faute de mieux?&rdquo; The little
French phrase came like an unexpected jewel, as if she had relapsed
unconsciously into a more familiar language.</p>
<p>I was strangely confused by the fact of our being alone
together. I had an entirely unwarranted feeling that we were about
to make up a quarrel. And I wanted to do my utmost to produce the
best possible impression upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I may call myself your brother&rsquo;s
friend,&rdquo; I began lamely. &ldquo;All my sympathies are with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the Jervaises particularly
well?&rdquo; she inquired. For one moment she glanced down at her
poised hands, but almost instantly returned to her rather
absent-minded gazing through the open window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except for Frank and his brother, I never met one of them
until last night,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;I was at school and
Cambridge with Frank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are your sort, your class,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you agree with them that it&rsquo;s a dreadful
thing for Arthur, their chauffeur&mdash;and he was in the stables
once, years ago&mdash;to try to run away with their
daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my sympathies are with Arthur,&rdquo; I repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not because the Jervaises were so rude to you?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I liked him before that; when we met on the hill, very
early this morning,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But, perhaps, he
didn&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he told me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And was that the
beginning of all the trouble between you and the
Jervaises?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way, it was,&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
an involved story and very silly. I admit that they had grounds for
suspecting that I had interfered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Jervaise and Olive are always suspecting
people,&rdquo; she volunteered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wondered
why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like that, by nature,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she said carelessly as if she did not
care to pursue that speculation. &ldquo;You know that my mother was
governess to Olive and Frank before she married my father?&rdquo;
she continued, still with that same air of discussing some remote,
detached topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard that she had been a governess. I didn&rsquo;t
know that she had ever been with the Jervaises,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was there for over two years,&rdquo; pursued Anne.
&ldquo;She is French, you know, though you&rsquo;d probably never
guess it, now, except for an occasional word here and there. She
left years before Brenda was born. Brenda is so much younger than
the others. There&rsquo;s eight years between her and Robert, the
next one. Olive&rsquo;s the eldest, of course, and then
Frank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made some conventional acknowledgment for this information. I
was wondering if she were merely talking to save the embarrassment
of silence. We had drifted, apparently, a long way from any matter
of personal interest and I was hesitating as to whether I should
not attempt a new opening, when she began again with the least
little frown of determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about them, because if you are to be
Arthur&rsquo;s friend you ought to know more or less how things are
between us and the Jervaises, and I might just as well say right
out at once that we don&rsquo;t like them; we&rsquo;ve never liked
them. Mother, more particularly. She has got something against them
that she has never told us, but it isn&rsquo;t that.&rdquo; Her
frown was more pronounced as she went on, &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t
nice people, any of them, except Brenda, and she&rsquo;s so
absolutely different from the rest of them, and doesn&rsquo;t like
them either&mdash;in a way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even except Frank?&rdquo; I mumbled. I
could not resist the opportunity she had offered to ask that too
pointed question; but I looked down at the floor as I spoke; I
wanted her to understand that I was not cross-examining her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you saw us,&rdquo; she returned in the same even
tone that she had used all through this conversation of ours. She
had not once raised or lowered her voice. She might have been
speaking a part, just to test her memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Quite by accident, of
course. I had no idea that he had come up here. I hadn&rsquo;t seen
him since breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a mistake,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>I looked up at her, hoping with no shadow of reason that I might
have played some part in her discovery that that caress in the wood
had been a mistake. But she had not changed colour nor moved her
attitude, and her voice was still free from any emotion as she
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought, Brenda and I thought, that we might trick
him. It was a piece of chicane. She and I were rather silly this
morning. We excite each other. In a sort of way she dared me. But I
was sorry afterwards and so was Brenda, although she thought it
might be better as I&rsquo;d gone so far to keep it up until Arthur
had got a promise or something out of Mr. Jervaise. I had meant to
do that. I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you think that Frank Jervaise realises that you
were only playing with him for your own ends, this morning?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes,&rdquo; she said with perfect assurance.
&ldquo;As a matter of fact, he was very suspicious this morning.
He&rsquo;s like his mother and sister in suspecting
everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;ll make trouble?&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Now? Up at the Hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. He&rsquo;s vindictive,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one reason why I&rsquo;m glad you are with us,
now. It might help&mdash;though I don&rsquo;t quite see how.
Perhaps it&rsquo;s just the feeling of having some one else on our
side. Because I&rsquo;m afraid that there&rsquo;s going to be a lot
of trouble when my father and mother come home. With my father,
more particularly. He&rsquo;ll be afraid of being turned out. It
will be very difficult to make him take up a new idea. He&rsquo;ll
hate the thought of leaving here and starting all over again in
Canada. He loves this place so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose he likes, or at least respects, the
Jervaises?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve made
it very difficult for us in many ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deliberately?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she said, warming a little
for the first time. &ldquo;They simply don&rsquo;t think of any one
but themselves. For instance, it mayn&rsquo;t seem much to you, but
it&rsquo;s part of our agreement with Mr. Jervaise to provide the
Hall with dairy when they&rsquo;re at home&mdash;at market prices,
of course. And then they&rsquo;ll go to town for two or three
months in the summer and take a lot of the servants with them, and
we&rsquo;re left to find a market for our dairy as best we can,
just when milk is most plentiful.&rdquo; She lifted her hands for a
moment in a graceful French gesture as she added, &ldquo;Often it
means just giving milk away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does your father complain about that?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>She turned and looked at me with a complete change of
expression. Her abstraction had vanished, giving place to an air
that confessed a deliberate caprice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To <em>us</em>,&rdquo; she said with a laugh that
delightfully indulged her father&rsquo;s weakness.</p>
<p>I needed nothing more to illuminate the relations of the Banks
family. With that single gesture she had portrayed her
father&rsquo;s character, and her own and her mother&rsquo;s
smiling consideration for him. Nevertheless I was still interested
in his attitude towards the Hall&mdash;with Anne as interpreter. I
knew that I should get a version noticeably different from the one
her brother had given me on the hill that morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said that your father hadn&rsquo;t much
<em>respect</em> for the Jervaises?&rdquo; I stipulated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the Jervaises as individuals,&rdquo; she amended,
&ldquo;but he has for the Family. And they aren&rsquo;t so much a
family to him as an Idea, an Institution, a sort of Religion.
Nothing would break him of that, nothing the Jervaises themselves
ever could do. He&rsquo;d be much more likely to lose his faith in
God than in the Rights of the Hall. That&rsquo;s one of his
sayings. He says they have rights, as if there was no getting over
that. It&rsquo;s just like people used to believe in the divine
right of kings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not know whether I was more fascinated by her theme or by
her exposition of it. &ldquo;Then, how is it that the rest of
you&hellip;?&rdquo; I began, but she had not the patience to wait
while I finished the question. She was suddenly eager, vivid,
astonishingly alive; a different woman from the Anne who had spoken
as if in her sleep, while plunged in some immense, engrossing
meditation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother,&rdquo; she broke in. &ldquo;The Jervaises mean
nothing to her, nothing of that sort. She wasn&rsquo;t brought up
on it. It isn&rsquo;t in her blood. In a way she&rsquo;s as good as
they are. Her grandfather was an emigr&eacute; from the
Revolution&mdash;not titled except just for the &lsquo;de&rsquo;,
you know&mdash;they had an estate near Rouen &hellip; but all this
doesn&rsquo;t interest you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does, profoundly,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>She looked at me with a spice of mischief in her eyes.
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>It was a tempting opening for a flirtation, but I could not
flirt with her. When I had first heard the clear, soft tones of her
voice at the window, I must have known that my meeting with her was
a new and decisive experience. I had always idealised a certain
type of woman, and perhaps for that reason I had always held back
from the possible disillusions of an exploring intimacy. But my
recognition of Anne had nothing in common with all my old
deliberately romantic searchings for a theoretical affinity. If I
had been asked at any time before two o&rsquo;clock that morning to
define my ideal, the definition would not have described Anne.
Indeed, I could never have imagined her. She was altogether too
individual, too positive, too independently real, to fit the
mawkish vapourings of a man&rsquo;s imaginary woman. There was
something about her that conquered me. Already I was blushingly
ashamed of my jealous suspicion that she could sell herself by a
marriage with Jervaise. In all her moods, she appeared to me with
an effect that I can only describe as &ldquo;convincing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was a perpetual revelation, and each new phase of her
thrilled me with admiration, and a sense of long-sought
satisfaction. I could be content to watch and to listen to her. The
revelations of her personality were to me as a continual and
glorious adventure. To flirt with her would be a confession on my
part of a kind of superiority that I could never feel; a suggestion
of the ridiculous assumption that I could afford to dally with and
in certain circumstances flout her. I could sooner have dallied
with and flouted a supreme work of art. Wherefore when she
challenged me with her daring &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I met her eyes
with a look that if it in any way represented what I was feeling,
must have expressed a grave and sincere humility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly tell you why,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I can
only assure you that I am profoundly interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She accepted that statement with a readiness that gave me
another thrill of satisfaction. She understood my desire and gave
way to it, instantly fulfilling my present need of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My great-grandfather went back to Paris after things had
settled down,&rdquo; she went on, as if there had been no break in
her narrative; &ldquo;just as a common workman. He was about
thirty-five, then, I believe; his first wife and his two children
had died of small-pox in Holland, and he didn&rsquo;t marry again
until he was sixty. He had only one child afterwards; that was my
grandmother. But I can&rsquo;t tell you the story properly. You
must get my mother to do that. She makes such a lovely romance out
of it. And it <em>is</em> rather romantic, too, isn&rsquo;t it? I
like to feel that I&rsquo;ve got that behind me rather than all the
stodgy old ancestors the Jervaises have got. Wouldn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; I agreed warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t miss all the important points
you&rsquo;d think so,&rdquo; Anne replied with a little childish
pucker of perplexity coming in her forehead. &ldquo;But
story-telling isn&rsquo;t a bit in my line. I wish it were. I can
listen to mother for hours, and I can never make out quite what it
is she does to make her stories so interesting. Of course she
generally tells them in French, which helps, but I&rsquo;m no
better in French than in English. Mother has a way of saying
&lsquo;Enfin&rsquo; or &lsquo;En effet&rsquo; that in itself is
quite thrilling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know quite how well you do it
yourself,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;Not like mother,&rdquo; she asserted.
With that childish pucker still wrinkling her forehead she looked
like a little girl of fourteen. I could see her gazing up at her
mother with some little halting perplexed question. I felt as if
she were giving me some almost miraculous confidence, obliterating
all the strangeness of new acquaintanceship by displaying the story
of her girlhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She puts mystery into it, too,&rdquo; she went on, still
intent on the difference between her own and her mother&rsquo;s
methods. &ldquo;And, I think, there really is some mystery that
she&rsquo;s never told us,&rdquo; she added as an afterthought.
&ldquo;After my grandfather died, her mother married again, a
widower with one little girl, and when she grew up mother got her
over here as a sort of finishing governess to Olive Jervaise. She
came a year or two before Brenda was born. She was born in Italy.
Did you know that? I always wonder whether that&rsquo;s why
she&rsquo;s so absolutely different from all the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She certainly is. I don&rsquo;t know whether that&rsquo;s
enough to explain it,&rdquo; I commented. &ldquo;And did your
mother&rsquo;s step-sister go abroad with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so. She never came back here afterwards. She
has been dead for ages, now. But mother&rsquo;s always rather
mysterious about her. That&rsquo;s how I began, wasn&rsquo;t it? I
know that she was very beautiful, and sometimes I think I can just
remember her. I must have been about four when she left here,
because I&rsquo;m rather more than four years older than
Brenda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought of Anne at four was not less fascinating to me than
the picture of her at fourteen. I was jealous of all her
twenty-three years of life. I wanted to have an intimate knowledge
of all her past being; of every least change and development that
she had suffered since babyhood.</p>
<p>But I was to have no more confidences of that sort just then.
The child disappeared from her face and speech as quickly as it had
come. She appeared to be dreaming, again, as she continued almost
without a pause,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t my mother I&rsquo;m sorry for in this
affair. She&rsquo;ll arrange herself. I think she&rsquo;ll be glad,
in a way. We all should if it weren&rsquo;t for my father.
We&rsquo;re so ruled by the Jervaises here. And it&rsquo;s worse
than that. Their&mdash;their prestige sort of hangs over you
everywhere. It&rsquo;s like being at the court of Louis Quatorze.
The estate is theirs and they are the estate. Mother often says we
are still f&eacute;odal down here. It seems to me sometimes that
we&rsquo;re little better than slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smiled at the grotesqueness of the idea. It was impossible to
conceive Anne as a slave.</p>
<p>She was still gazing out of the window with that appearance of
abstraction, but she was evidently aware of my smile, for she
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think that&rsquo;s absurd, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In connection with you,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t see you as any one&rsquo;s slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave me her attention again. &ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t
be,&rdquo; she threw at me with a hint of defiance; and before I
had time to reply, continued, &ldquo;I was angry with Arthur for
coming back. To go into service! I almost quarrelled with mother
over that. She was so weak about it. She hated his being so far
away. She didn&rsquo;t seem to mind anything as long as she could
get him home again. But Arthur&rsquo;s more like my father.
He&rsquo;s got a strain of Jervaise-worship in him,
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very strong strain, just now,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>She laughed. &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s Brenda&rsquo;s slave; always
will be,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t count her as a
Jervaise. She&rsquo;s an insurg&eacute;e like me&mdash;against her
own family. She&rsquo;d do anything to get away from
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she will now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and your
brother, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That seemed to annoy her. &ldquo;It may sound easy enough to
you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s going to be anything
but easy. You can&rsquo;t possibly understand how difficult
it&rsquo;s going to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders as if she had suddenly become tired
of my questions, perhaps of myself, also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so outside it all,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I am,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;But&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t want to remain outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;ve been telling you as
much as I have,&rdquo; she returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only plead my profound interest,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Arthur? Or in us, generally?&rdquo; she inquired and
frowned as if she forbade me to say that my chief interest might be
in herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all of you and in the situation,&rdquo; I tried,
hoping to please her. &ldquo;I was prepared to dislike the
Jervaises and all they stood for, before this talk with you.
Now&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re well off, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she
said with a faint air of contempt. &ldquo;<em>You</em> can&rsquo;t
be an insurg&eacute;. You&rsquo;d be playing against your own
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think that, why did you give me so much confidence
to begin with?&rdquo; I retaliated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m always doing silly things,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;It was silly to play with that foolish Jervaise man this
morning. It was silly to offend him this evening. I
don&rsquo;t&mdash;<em>think</em>. I ought to be whipped.&rdquo; She
had apparently forgotten her recent distrust of me, for she
continued in the tone of one who makes an ultimate confession.
&ldquo;As a matter of fact, I suppose I&rsquo;m chiefly responsible
for the whole thing. I egged them on. Arthur would have gone on
adoring Brenda as a kind of divinity for ever, if I hadn&rsquo;t
brought them together. He&rsquo;s afraid to touch her, even now. I
just didn&rsquo;t think. I never do till it&rsquo;s too
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not sorry&mdash;about them, are
you?&rdquo; I put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for my father,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m terribly sorry for him.&rdquo; Her eyes were
extraordinarily tender and compassionate as she spoke. I felt that
if any lover of Anne&rsquo;s could ever inspire such devotion as
showed in her face at that moment, he would indeed be blest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sixty,&rdquo; she went on in a low, brooding
voice, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s
so&mdash;rooted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no chance of their letting you stay on, if
Arthur and Brenda went to Canada?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>Her face was suddenly hard again as she replied. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s one chance in a million,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;The Jervaise prestige couldn&rsquo;t stand such
relations as us, living at their very doors. Besides, I know
I&rsquo;ve upset that horrid Jervaise man. He&rsquo;ll be
revengeful. He&rsquo;s so weak, and that sort are always
vindictive. He&rsquo;ll be mean and spiteful. Oh! no, it&rsquo;s
one of two things, either Arthur will have to go back to Canada
without Brenda, or we&rsquo;ll all have to go together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her tone and attitude convinced me. If I had been able to
consider the case logically and without prejudice, I should
probably have scorned this presentation of rigid alternatives as
the invention of a romantic mind; I might have recognised in it the
familiar device of the dramatist. But I had so far surrendered
myself to the charm of Anne&rsquo;s individuality that I accepted
her statement without the least shadow of criticism. It was the
search to find some mechanical means of influencing the
Jervaises&rsquo; decision that reminded me of Arthur Banks&rsquo;s
hint of an advantage that he might use in a last emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your brother told me last night,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;that there was some&mdash;&lsquo;pull&rsquo; or other he
had, that might make a difference if it came to desperate
measures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell you what it was?&rdquo; she asked,
and I knew at once that she was, after all, in her brother&rsquo;s
confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he gave me no idea,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t ever use that,&rdquo; she said
decidedly. &ldquo;He told me about it this morning, before he went
up to the Hall, and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dissuaded him?&rdquo; I suggested, as she paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! He saw it, himself,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t like Arthur&mdash;to think of such a
thing, even&mdash;at ordinary times. But after his quarrel with
Brenda on the hill&mdash;if you could call it a quarrel, when, so
far as I can make out, Arthur never said a word the whole
time&mdash;after that, and Brenda being so eager to face them all
out, this morning; he got a little beyond himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Brenda know about this&mdash;pull?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Anne replied indignantly.
&ldquo;How could we tell her that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least notion what it is, you
see,&rdquo; I apologised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s about old Mr. Jervaise,&rdquo; Anne
explained without the least show of reluctance.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some woman or other he goes to see in town.
And once or twice Arthur took him in the car. They forget
we&rsquo;re human beings at all, sometimes, you know. They think
we&rsquo;re just servants and don&rsquo;t notice things; or if we
do notice them, that we shouldn&rsquo;t be so disrespectful as to
say anything. I don&rsquo;t know what they think. Anyhow, he let
Arthur drive him&mdash;twice, I believe it was&mdash;and the second
time Arthur looked at him when he came out of the house, and Mr.
Jervaise must have known that Arthur guessed. Nothing was said, of
course, but he didn&rsquo;t ever take Arthur again; but Arthur
knows the woman&rsquo;s name and address. It was in some flats, and
the porter told him something, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I realised that I had wasted my sympathy on old Jervaise. His
air of a criminal awaiting arrest had been more truly indicative
than I could have imagined possible. He had been expecting
blackmail; had probably been willing to pay almost any price to
avoid the scandal. I wondered how far the morning interview had
relieved his mind?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That explains Mr. Jervaise&rsquo;s state of nerves this
morning,&rdquo; I remarked. &ldquo;I could see that he was
frightfully upset, but I thought it was about Brenda. I had an idea
that he might be very devoted to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne pushed that aside with a gesture, as quite unworthy of
comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, surely, that really does give your brother some kind
of advantage,&rdquo; I went on thoughtlessly. I suppose that I was
too intent on keeping Anne in England to understand exactly what my
speech implied.</p>
<p>She looked at me with a superb scorn. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
mean to say,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you think we&rsquo;d take
advantage of a thing like that? Father&mdash;or any of
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had almost the same sense of being unjustly in disgrace that I
had had during the Hall luncheon party. I do not quite know what
made me grasp at the hint of an omission from her bravely delivered
&ldquo;any of us.&rdquo; I was probably snatching at any straw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother would feel like that, too?&rdquo; I dared in
my extremity.</p>
<p>Any ordinary person would have parried that question by a
semblance of indignation or by asking what I meant by it. Anne made
no attempt to disguise the fact that the question had been
justified. Her scorn gave way to a look of perplexity; and when she
spoke she was staring out of the window again, as if she sought the
spirit of ultimate truth on some, to me, invisible horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t practical,&rdquo; was Anne&rsquo;s excuse
for her mother. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so&mdash;so romantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I was being unpractical and romantic,
too,&rdquo; I apologised, rejoicing in my ability to make use of
the precedent.</p>
<p>Anne just perceptibly pursed her lips, and her eyes turned
towards me with the beginning of a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little thought what a romance you were coming into
when you accepted the invitation for that week-end&mdash;did
you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; was all the comment I could find; but
I put a world of feeling into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I very nearly refused,&rdquo; I went on, with the
excitement of one who makes a thrilling announcement.</p>
<p>Anne humoured my eagerness with a tolerant smile.
&ldquo;<em>Did</em> you?&rdquo; she said encouragingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the merest chance that I accepted,&rdquo; I
replied. &ldquo;I was curious about the Jervaise family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Satisfied?&rdquo; Anne asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been given an opportunity of knowing
them from the inside,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be writing a play about us,&rdquo; Anne
remarked carelessly.</p>
<p>I was astonished to find that she knew I had written plays.
&ldquo;How did you know that I did that sort of thing?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen one of them,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;&rsquo;<em>The Mulberry Bush</em>&rsquo;; when mother and I
were in London last winter. And Arthur said you were the same Mr.
Melhuish. I suppose Frank Jervaise had told him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People who go to the theatre don&rsquo;t generally notice
the name of the author,&rdquo; I commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in the
theatre. I&rsquo;ve read dozens of plays, in French, mostly. I
don&rsquo;t think the English comedies are nearly so well done. Of
course, the French have only one subject, but they are so much more
witty. Have you ever read <em>Les Hannetons</em>, for
instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve seen the English version on the
stage,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>I was ashamed of having written <em>The Mulberry Bush</em>, of
having presumed to write any comedy. I felt the justice of her
implied criticism. Indeed, all my efforts seemed to me, just then,
as being worthless and insincere. All my life, even. There was
something definite and keen about this girl of twenty-three that
suddenly illuminated my intellectual and moral flabbiness. She had
already a definite attitude towards social questions that I had
never bothered to investigate. She had shown herself to have a
final pride in the matter of blackmailing old Jervaise. And in half
a dozen words she had exposed the lack of real wit in my attempts
at playwriting. I was humbled before her superior intelligence. Her
speech had still a faint flavour of the uneducated, but her
judgments were brilliantly incisive; despite her inferentially
limited experience, she had a clearer sight of humanity than I
had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t look so depressed,&rdquo; she
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking what a pity it is that you should go to
Canada,&rdquo; I returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to feel free
and independent; not a chattel of the Jervaises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;Canada!&rdquo; I remonstrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I could never leave my
father and mother. Wherever they go, I must go, too. They&rsquo;ve
no one but me to look after them. And this does, at last, seem, in
a way, a chance. Only, I can&rsquo;t trust myself. I&rsquo;m too
impulsive about things like this. Oh! do you think it might kill my
father if he were torn up by the roots? Sometimes I think it might
be good for him, and at others I&rsquo;m horribly
afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, I&rsquo;ve never seen him&hellip;&rdquo;
I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in any case, you&rsquo;re prejudiced,&rdquo; she
interrupted me. Her tone had changed again; it was suddenly light,
almost coquettish, and she looked at me with a challenging lift of
her eyebrows, as if, most astonishingly, she had read my secret
adoration of her and defied me to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way am I prejudiced?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! here&rsquo;s Brenda coming back,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>I regretted extremely that Brenda should have returned at that
moment, but I was tremendously encouraged. Anne seemed in that one
sentence to have sanctioned the understanding that I was in love
with her. Her warning of the interruption seemed to carry some
unspoken promise that I should be given another opportunity.</p>
<h3 class="title"><a name="Ch_XII" id="Ch_XII"></a>XII</h3>
<h2>Conversion</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Anne had not once moved from her original place by the table in
the course of that long conversation of ours, and she still stood
there, her finger-tips resting on the oak with a powerful effect of
poise when Brenda came into the room.</p>
<p>Brenda&rsquo;s actions were far more vivacious than her
friend&rsquo;s. She came in with an air of youthful exuberance,
looked at me with a shade of inquiry, and then sat down opposite
Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came back over the hill and through the wood,&rdquo;
she said, resting her elbows on the table and her chin on her
hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a topping evening. Poor Arthur; I wish I
could have gone with him. I offered to, but he didn&rsquo;t want me
to come. I&rsquo;m not sure he didn&rsquo;t think they might kidnap
me if I went too near.&rdquo; She turned to me with a bright smile
as she added, &ldquo;Could they keep me, Mr. Melhuish; shut me up
or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite sure about that,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;but they could arrest&mdash;Arthur&rdquo;&mdash;(I could not
call him anything else, I found)&mdash;&ldquo;if he ran away with
you. On a charge of abduction, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could make it pretty nasty for us all round, in
fact,&rdquo; Brenda concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they could,&rdquo; I agreed.</p>
<p>She was looking extraordinarily pretty. The bizarre contrast
between her dark eyelashes and her fair hair seemed to find some
kind of echo in the combination of health and fragility that she
expressed in her movements. She appeared at once vital and delicate
without being too highly-strung. I could well understand how the
bucolic strain in Arthur Banks was prostrate with admiration before
such a rare and exciting beauty.</p>
<p>By the side of Brenda, Anne looked physically robust. The
developed lines of her figure emphasised Brenda&rsquo;s fragility.
And yet Anne&rsquo;s eyes, her whole pose, expressed a spirituality
that Brenda lacked. Anne, with her amazing changes of mood, her
rapid response to emotion, gave expression to some spirit not less
feminine than Brenda&rsquo;s, but infinitely deeper. Behind the
moving shadows and sunlight of her impulses there lay always some
reminder of a constant orientation. She might trifle brilliantly
with the surface of life, but her soul was more steadfast than a
star. Brenda might love passionately, but her love would be
relatively personal, selfish. When Anne gave herself, she would
love like a mother, with her whole being.</p>
<p>I came out of my day-dream to find that she was speaking of
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Melhuish is half asleep,&rdquo; she was saying.
&ldquo;And I haven&rsquo;t got his room ready after all this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t get much sleep last night,&rdquo; Brenda
replied. &ldquo;We none of us did for that matter. We were
wandering round the Park and just missing each other like the
people in <em>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and help me to get that room ready,&rdquo; Anne
said. &ldquo;Father and mother may be home any minute. They ought
to have been back before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brenda was on her feet in a moment. She appeared glad to have
some excuse for action. She was, no doubt, nervous and excited as
to the probable result of her lover&rsquo;s mission to the Hall,
and wanted to be alone with Anne in order that they might speculate
upon those probabilities which Banks&rsquo;s return would presently
transform into certainties.</p>
<p>Anne turned to me before they left the room and indicated three
shelves of books half hidden behind the settle. &ldquo;You might
find something to read there, unless you&rsquo;d sooner have a
nap,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t be having supper until
eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I preferred, however, to go out and make my own estimate of
probabilities in the serenity of the August evening. My mind was
too full to read. I wanted to examine my own ideas just then, not
those of some other man or woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going for a walk,&rdquo; I said to Anne.
&ldquo;I want to think.&rdquo; And I looked at her with a greater
boldness than I had dared hitherto. I claimed a further recognition
of that understanding she had, as I believed, so recently
admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think out that play?&rdquo; she returned lightly, but
her expression did not accord with her tone. She had paused at the
door, and as she looked back at me, there was a suggestion of
sadness in her face, of regret, or it might even have been of
remorse. She looked, I thought, as though she were sorry for
me.</p>
<p>She was gone before I could speak again.</p>
<hr />
<p>I found my way out by the back door through which Jervaise and I
had entered all those incalculable hours ago; and I looked up at
the window from which Anne&rsquo;s beautiful voice had hailed me
out of the night. I wanted to think about her, to recall how she
had looked and spoken&mdash;at that window; in the course of her
talk with Frank Jervaise; in the recent scene in the farm
sitting-room when she had ambushed herself so persistently behind
the ear of the settle; and, most of all, I desired to weigh every
tone and expression I could remember in that last long conversation
of ours; every least gesture or attention that might give me a hope
of having won, in some degree, her regard or interest.</p>
<p>But the perplexing initiative of my intelligence would not, for
some reason, permit me to concentrate my thoughts on her at that
moment. My mind was bewilderingly full of Anne, but I could not
think of her. When I fell into the pose of gazing up at her window,
the association suggested not the memory I desired, but the picture
of Frank Jervaise fumbling in the darkness of the porch, and the
excruciating anguish of Racquet&rsquo;s bark. From that I fell to
wondering why I had not seen Racquet on this occasion of my second
visit? I had not remembered him until then.</p>
<p>I pulled myself up with an effort, and finding the surroundings
of the yard so ineffectual as a stimulus, I wandered down the hill
towards the wood. I suggested to myself that I might meet Banks
returning from the Hall, but my chief hope was that I might revive
the romance of the night.</p>
<p>The sun was setting clear and red, a different portent from the
veiled thing that had finally hidden itself in a huddle of purple
and gray cloud the night before. I had seen it from my bedroom at
the Hall as I dressed for dinner and had mildly regretted the
threat of possible bad weather. I had been a little bored by the
anticipations I had formed of my week-end. The Jervaises, from what
I had seen of them, promised, I thought, to be uncommonly dull. I
had not seen Brenda before dinner.</p>
<p>I roused myself again and made an effort to shift the depression
that was settling upon me, but the mood was not to be exorcised by
any deliberate attempt to revive the glow of adventure that had
warmed my earlier excursions through the wood. The very stillness
of the evening, the air of preparation for repose, the first faint
suggestions of the passage from summer to autumn, all had some
effect of pervading melancholy. I found myself speculating on the
promise of change that my talk with Anne had foreshadowed; of the
uprooting of Farmer Banks, of the family&rsquo;s emigration, and
the sadness of their farewells to this exquisitely peaceful country
of England.</p>
<p>And then the thought that I had unconsciously feared and
repressed since I had left the farm, broke through all these
artificial abstractions and forced itself upon my attention. I
struggled against it vainly for a few seconds and then braced
myself to meet the realisation of my own failure. For it was that
shadow which had been stalking me since Anne had so obliquely
criticised my comedy. And it seemed to me now that her last strange
expression as she left the room, that look of pity and regret, had
all too surely indicated the certainty that she&mdash;I faced it
with a kind of bitter despair&mdash;that she despised me. I was
&ldquo;well-off.&rdquo; I belonged to the Jervaises&rsquo; class.
She had flung those charges at me contemptuously before she had
finally dismissed my one futile claim to distinction by classing me
among the writers of that artificial English comedy which had not
even the redeeming virtue of wit.</p>
<p>Not once in that long conversation with her had she shown the
sudden spark of recognition that had so wonderfully lighted my
parting with her in the night. She had given me her confidence
about her family affairs because she counted me as a new ally,
however ineffective, coming in unexpectedly to fight against the
Jervaises. She had acknowledged my worship of her because she was
too clear-sighted and too honest to shirk my inevitable
declaration. But I could not doubt that she rated me as unworthy of
her serious attention. Her whole attitude proclaimed that her one
instant of reaching out towards me had been a mistake; one of the
many impulses that continually blossomed and died in her close
intercourse with the spirit of life.</p>
<p>And I could not blame her for her contempt of me. I despised
myself. I was a man without a serious interest. I had escaped vice,
but I had always lived among surface activities. My highest
ambition after I left Cambridge had been to have one of my foolish
plays mounted in a West-End theatre. I had wanted to be talked
about, to be a social success. And I had achieved that ambition
without much difficulty. I had had an independent income&mdash;left
me by my father who had died when I was in my second year at
Jesus&mdash;only three hundred a year, but enough for me to live
upon without working. I had gone often to the theatre in those
days, and had scraped up an acquaintance with a middle-aged actor,
whose chief occupation had been the stage-managing of new
productions. With his help I had studied stagecraft by attending
rehearsals, the best possible school for a would-be dramatist. And
my first accepted play had been written in collaboration with him.
It had not been a great success, but I had gained invaluable
experience, and, after that, success had come to me rapidly and
easily. I found that I had the knack of writing pleasant little
artificial comedies. None of them had run for longer than eight
months, and I had only written five in all, but they had made me
comparatively rich. At that time my investments alone were bringing
me in nearly two thousand a year.</p>
<p>I was thirty-two, now, and it seemed to me looking back, that I
had never had one worthy ambition in all those years. I had never
even been seriously in love. Most deplorable of all I had never
looked forward to a future that promised anything but repetitions
of the same success.</p>
<p>What had I to live for? I saw before me a life of idleness with
no decent occupation, no objects, but the amassing of more money,
the seeking of a wider circle of acquaintances, dinner-parties at
more select houses, an increasing reputation as a deviser of
workmanlike, tolerably amusing plays. If I had had vices such as a
promiscuous love of women, I might have found the anticipation of
such a future more tolerable. There might, then, have been some
incitement to new living, new experience. But I had nothing.</p>
<p>Yet until that evening in the wood I had hardly paused to
consider what would presently become of me. The gradual increase in
my scale of personal luxury had brought sufficient diversion and
satisfaction. I had lived in the pleasures of the moment, and had
only rarely been conscious that those pleasures were growing stale;
that the crust of life upon which I had so diligently crawled, was
everywhere and always the same.</p>
<p>Now it was as if that monotonous surface had amazingly split. My
crawling was paralysed and changed to a terrified stillness. I had
paused, horrified, at the mouth of a pit, and gazed down with a
sick loathing at the foundations of my life that had been so
miraculously revealed. I did, indeed, stand suddenly stock still in
the wood, and staring down the darkening vista of the path, saw not
the entranced twilight that was sinking the path in a pool of olive
green shadows, but a kind of bioscopic presentation of my own
futile, monotonous existence.</p>
<p>If Anne would have nothing to do with me, what, I asked myself,
did the world hold that could conceivably make my life worth
living?</p>
<p>I suppose most men and women have asked themselves the same
question when they have been unexpectedly stirred by a great love.
The sense of unworthiness comes with a shock of surprise that seems
violently to tear open the comfortable cloak of self-satisfaction.
I had been content with my life, even a little vain of my
achievement, until that last conversation with Anne; now I loathed
the thought of my own inefficiency and all my prospects of success
appeared unendurably tame. I was in the spiritual state of a
religious convert, suddenly convinced of sin.</p>
<p>And yet somehow in the depths of my consciousness there was a
sensible stir of resentment. The artificial being I had created
during my thirty-two years of life had an existence of its own and
protested against this threat of instant annihilation. I wanted to
defend myself, and I was petulantly irritable because I could find
no defence.</p>
<p>For the strange Fate that had planned this astounding revelation
to me, had apparently led up to it by the subtlest arrangement of
properties and events. My disgrace at the Jervaises&rsquo; had
prepared me for this moment. My responses to humiliation had been,
as it were, tested and strained by that ordeal. And at the same
time I had been powerfully influenced to despise the life of the
Jervaises and all that they stood for, socially and ethically.
Then, almost without a pause, a new ideal of life had been
presented to me; and the contrast had been so vivid as to awaken
even my dulled powers of apprehension. The Jervaise type was more
or less familiar to me; their acceptance of security as an
established right, their lack of anything like initiative, their
general contentment with themselves, their standards of judgment
and their surroundings, represented the attitude towards life with
which I was most familiar. It had been my own attitude. I had even
dreamed of re-establishing the half-ruined home of the elder branch
of the Melhuish family in Derbyshire!</p>
<p>And the contrast afforded by the lives and ambitions of Anne and
her brother had been so startling that I believe I must have been
stirred by it to some kind of awakening even had I not fallen in
love with Anne. I had been given so perfect an opportunity to enter
into their feelings and views by my strange and intimate
association with their antagonism to all that was typified by the
rule of the Hall. By reason of my sympathy with the Banks I had
been able to realise the virtue of struggle and the evils of the
almost unlimited and quite indiscriminating power wielded by such
landowners as old Jervaise. And in condemning him and his family, I
must condemn myself also. We were all of us so smug and
self-satisfied. We had blindly believed that it was our birthright
to reap where we had not sown.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, though the truth was so plain to me in that
moment, I accepted it grudgingly. The voice of my artificial self
clamoured for a hearing. But these things were so, had always been
so, it protested; what could I do to change them? And probably, if
it had not been for the force of the thrilling passion of reverence
and admiration for Anne that had suddenly illuminated my whole
being, the cultivated inertia of a life-time would finally have
conquered me. I should have thrust the problem away from me and
returned with a sensual satisfaction to the familiar way of life I
understood. I should have consoled myself with the reflection that
mine was not the temperament to face the ardours and
disappointments of struggle.</p>
<p>As it was, I longed so furiously to justify myself before Anne;
to win, by some heroic measure, her good opinion, that the
incentive of my passion bore me triumphantly over the first
re-actions of inertia and protest. I could never return to my old
complacency, although the mechanical, accustomed habit of my
thought had for me, as yet, no suggestion other than some change in
the ideal and manner of my writing. I thought vaguely of attempting
some didactic drama to illustrate the tragic contrast between
gentle and simple that had been so glaringly illuminated for me by
recent experience. Yet, even as I played with that idea, I
recognised it as a device of my old self to allay my discontent. I
caught myself speculating on the promise of the play&rsquo;s
success, on the hope of winning new laurels as an earnest student
of sociology. I thrust that temptation from me with a sneer at my
own inherent hypocrisy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what else can you do?&rdquo; argued my old self and
my only reply was to bluster. I bullied myself. I treated myself as
a foolish child. The new spirit in me waved its feeble arms and
shouted wildly of its splendid intentions. I could be immensely
valiant in the presence of this single listener, but the thought of
Anne humiliated and subdued even this bright new spirit that had so
amazingly taken possession of me. I wondered if I might not submit
my problem to her ask her what she would have me to do.
Nevertheless, I knew that if I would win her esteem, I must act on
my own initiative.</p>
<p>My conflict and realisation of new desires had had, however, one
salutary effect. The depression of my earlier mood had fallen from
me. When I looked round at the widening pool of darkness that
flowed and deepened about the undergrowth, I found that it produced
no longer any impression of melancholy.</p>
<p>I lifted my head and marched forward with the resolution of a
conqueror.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was nearly clear of the wood when I saw Banks coming towards
me. He was carrying my suit-case, and behind him Racquet with a
sprightly bearing of the tail that contradicted the droop of his
head, followed with the body of a young rabbit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loot from the Hall?&rdquo; I asked when I came within
speaking distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s been poaching again,&rdquo; Banks said,
disregarding the application of my remark to the suit-case.
&ldquo;Well, he can, now, for all I care. He can have every blessed
rabbit and pheasant in the Park if he likes. I&rsquo;m done with
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things gone badly?&rdquo; I asked, stretching out my hand
for the suit-case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry it,&rdquo; he said, ignoring my
question. &ldquo;John had it ready packed when I got
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remembered with a passing qualm that John had not been tipped,
but put that thought away as a matter of no pressing importance.
&ldquo;Had he?&rdquo; I commented. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve
carried it half-way, now, I&rsquo;ll carry it the other
half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can but you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I replied.
&ldquo;Hand it over.&rdquo; I regarded the carrying of that
suit-case as a symbol of my new way of life. I hoped that when we
arrived at the Farm, Anne might see me carrying it, and realise
that even a writer of foolish comedies, who was well off and
belonged to the Jervaises&rsquo; class, might aspire to be the
equal of her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Banks said, and his manner
struck a curious mean between respect and friendship.</p>
<p>I laid hold of the suit-case and took it from him almost by
force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, it isn&rsquo;t so much a suit-case as a
parable,&rdquo; I explained.</p>
<p>He looked at me, still reluctant, with an air of perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A badge of my friendship for you and your family,&rdquo;
I enlarged. &ldquo;You and I, my boy, are pals, now. I take it
you&rsquo;ve left the Jervaises&rsquo; service for good. Imagine
that this is Canada, not an infernal Park with a label on every
blade of grass warning you not to touch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;But
it&rsquo;s extraordinary how it hangs about you. You know&mdash;the
feeling that they&rsquo;ve somehow got you, everywhere. Damn it, if
I met the old man in the wood I don&rsquo;t believe I could help
touching my hat to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just habit,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mighty strong one, though,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you&rsquo;re breathing the free air of Canada
again,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I may
have to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made sounds of encouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or go alone,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve cut up rough, then?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young Frank has, anyway,&rdquo; he said with a brave
assumption of breaking away from servility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see the old man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never a sight of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And young Frank&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoved it home for all he was worth. Threatened me with
the law and what not. Said if I tried to take Her with me
they&rsquo;d have us stopped and take an action against me for
abduction. I suppose it&rsquo;s all right that they can do
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it is,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;until she
comes of age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad I&rsquo;d taken the car back, anyhow,&rdquo; Banks
muttered, and I guessed that young Frank&rsquo;s vindictiveness had
not been overestimated by Anne. No doubt, he would have been glad
enough to complicate the issue by alleging Banks&rsquo;s theft of
that car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you propose to do now?&rdquo; I asked,
after a short interval of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Banks said
desperately, and then added, &ldquo;It depends chiefly on
Her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll probably vote for an elopement,&rdquo; I
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if they come after us and I&rsquo;m
bagged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let yourself get bagged. Escape
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you think she&rsquo;d agree to that? Sneaking off
and hiding? Dodging about to get out of the country,
somehow?&rdquo; His tone left me uncertain whether he were asking a
question or spurning the idea in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the alternative?&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might wait,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be of
age in thirteen months&rsquo; time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had no fear but that Banks would wait thirteen months, or
thirteen years, for Brenda. I was less certain about her. Just now
she was head over ears in romance, and I believed that if she
married him his sterling qualities would hold her. But I mistrusted
the possible effect upon her of thirteen months&rsquo; absence. The
Jervaises would know very well how to use their advantage. They
would take her away from the Hall and its associations, and plunge
her into the distractions of a society that could not yet have lost
its glamour for her. I could picture Brenda looking back with
wonder at the foolishness of the girl who had imagined herself to
be in love with her father&rsquo;s chauffeur. And even an hour
earlier, so recent had been my true conversion, I should have
questioned the advisability of a hasty, secret marriage between
these two temporarily infatuated people. Now I was hot with the
evangelising passion of a young disciple. I wanted to deliver
Brenda from the thrall of society at any price. It seemed to me
that the greatest tragedy for her would be a marriage with some one
in her own class&mdash;young Turnbull, for instance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; I said decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked with a touch of resentment, as
if he had guessed something of my mistrust of Brenda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All very well, in a way, for you,&rdquo; I explained.
&ldquo;But think what an awful time she&rsquo;d have, with all of
them trying to nag her into a marriage with young Turnbull, or
somebody of that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t so bad as some of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; Banks
said, evading the main issue. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d never marry him
though. She knows him too well, for one thing. He&rsquo;s been
scouring the county in a dog-cart all the morning&mdash;went to
Hurley to make inquiries before breakfast, and all over the place
afterwards. John&rsquo;s been telling me. He heard &rsquo;em
talking when young Turnbull turned up at tea-time. He&rsquo;s got
guts all right, that fellow. I believe he&rsquo;d play the game
fair enough if they tried to make her marry him. Besides, as I
said, she&rsquo;d never do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose she would,&rdquo; I said, humouring
him&mdash;it was no part of my plan to disturb his perfect faith in
Brenda&mdash;&ldquo;I only said that she&rsquo;d have a rotten bad
time during those thirteen months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to leave that to her, haven&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo; Banks returned.</p>
<p>I thought not, but I judged it more tactful to keep my opinion
to myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be quite safe in doing that,&rdquo; I said as we
turned into the back premises of the Home Farm.</p>
<p>Banks had forgotten about my suit-case, and I bore the burden of
it, flauntingly, up the hill. Racquet followed us with an air of
conscious humility.</p>
<p>And it was Racquet that Anne first addressed when she met us at
the door of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose rabbit is that?&rdquo; she asked sternly.</p>
<p>Racquet instantly dropped his catch and slowly approached Anne
with a mien of exaggerated abasement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were an out and out socialist, I shouldn&rsquo;t
mind,&rdquo; Anne continued, &ldquo;but you shouldn&rsquo;t do
these things if you&rsquo;re ashamed of them afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Racquet continued to supplicate her with bowed head, but he gave
one surreptitious flick of his stumpy tail, that to me had the
irresistible suggestion of a wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hypocrite!&rdquo; Anne said, whereupon Racquet, correctly
judging by her tone that his forgiveness was assured, made one
splendid leap at her, returned with an altogether too patent
eagerness to his rabbit, picked it up, and trotted away round the
corner of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a humbug?&rdquo; Anne asked looking at me,
and continued without waiting for my confirmation of the epithet,
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you let Arthur carry that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He carried it half the way,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He and
I are the out and out kind of socialist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not smile. &ldquo;Father and mother are home,&rdquo; she
said, turning to her brother. &ldquo;I can see by your face the
sort of thing they&rsquo;ve been saying to you at the Hall, so I
suppose we&rsquo;d better have the whole story on the carpet over
supper. Father&rsquo;s been asking already what Brenda&rsquo;s here
for.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Farmer Banks</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Anne showed me up to my room as soon as we entered the house,
but her manner was that of the hostess to a strange guest. She was
polite, formal, and, I thought, a trifle nervous. She left me
hurriedly as soon as she had opened the door of the bedroom, with
some apology about having to &ldquo;see to the supper.&rdquo; (The
smell of frying bacon had pervaded the staircase and passages, and
had helped me to realise that I was most uncommonly hungry. Except
for a very light lunch I had eaten nothing since breakfast.)</p>
<p>I got my first real feeling of the strangeness of the whole
affair while I was unpacking my suit-case in that rather stiff,
unfriendly spare-room. Until then the sequence of events had
followed a hot succession, in the current of which I had had no
time to consider myself&mdash;my ordinary, daily self&mdash;in
relation to them. But the associations of this familiar position
and occupation, this adaptation of myself for a few hours to a
strange household, evoked the habitual sensations of a hundred
similar experiences. Twenty-four hours earlier I had been dressing
for dinner at Jervaise Hall, and despite my earnest affirmations
that in the interval my whole life and character had changed, I was
very surely aware that I was precisely the same man I had always
been&mdash;the man who washed, and changed his tie, and brushed his
hair in just this same manner every day; who looked at himself in
the glass with that same half-frowning, half-anxious expression, as
if he were uncertain whether to resent or admire the familiar
reflection. I was confronted by the image of the Graham Melhuish to
whom I had become accustomed; the image of the rather well-groomed,
rather successful young man that I had come to regard as the
complete presentation of my individuality.</p>
<p>But now I saw that that image in the glass could never have done
the things that I had done that day. I could not imagine that
stereotyped creature wanting to fight Frank Jervaise, running away
from the Hall, taking the side of a chauffeur in an intrigue with
his master&rsquo;s daughter, falling in love with a woman he had
not known for twenty-four hours, and, culminating wonder, making
extraordinary determinations to renounce the pleasures and comforts
of life in order to &hellip; I could not quite define what, but the
substitute was something very strenuous and difficult and
self-sacrificing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some one had done all these things, and if it were
not that conventional, self-satisfied impersonation now staring
back at me with a look of perplexed inquiry, where was I to find
his outward likeness? Had I looked a different man when I was
talking to Anne in the Farm parlour or when I had communed with
myself in the wood? Or if the real Graham Melhuish were something
better and deeper than this fraudulent reflection of him, how could
he get out, get through, in some way or other achieve a permanent
expression to replace this deceptive mask? Also, which of us was
doing the thinking at that moment? Did we take it turn and turn
about? Five minutes before the old, familiar Melhuish had
undoubtedly been unpacking his bag in his old familiar way, and
wondering how he had come to do all the queer things he
unquestionably had been doing in the course of this amazing
weekend. Now, the new Melhuish was uppermost again, speculating
about the validity of his soul&mdash;a subject that had certainly
never concerned the other fellow, hitherto.</p>
<p>But it was the other fellow who was in the ascendant when I
entered the farm sitting-room in answer to the summons of a
falsetto bell. I was shy. I felt like an intruder. I was afraid
that Farmer Banks would treat me as a distinguished visitor, and
that my efforts to attain the happy freedom of an equal
might&mdash;in the eyes of Anne&mdash;appear condescending. The new
self I had so lately discovered was everybody&rsquo;s equal, but,
just then, I was out of touch with my new self.</p>
<p>Nor did Farmer Banks&rsquo;s natural courtesy tend to put me at
ease. He and Arthur were alone in the room when I came down and it
was Arthur who, with an evident self-consciousness, introduced
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Melhuish, father,&rdquo; was all he said, and I had
no idea how much of the story the old man had, as yet, been
told.</p>
<p>He made a kind of stiff bow and held out his hand.
&ldquo;Pleased to meet you, Mr. Melhuish,&rdquo; he said, and his
manner struck a mean between respectfulness and self-assertion. It
was the kind of manner that he might have shown to a titled
canvasser just before an election.</p>
<p>He was a notably handsome man, tall and broad, with regular,
impassive features and blue eyes exactly the colour of
Arthur&rsquo;s. Save that his back was slightly rounded and that
his closely-cropped hair was iron-gray, he showed little mark of
his sixty years. He seemed to me the very type of an English
yeoman, not markedly intelligent outside his own speciality, and
conservative to the point of fanaticism. When I thought of trying
to persuade him to forsake the usage of a lifetime and begin again
in a foreign country under new conditions, my heart failed me.
Upstairs, before the looking-glass, I had had my doubts of the
possibility of ever ousting the old Graham Melhuish; but those
doubts appeared the most childish exaggerations of difficulty when
compared with my doubts of persuading the man before me to alter
his habits and his whole way of life. It seemed to me that the
spirit of Farmer Banks must be encrusted beyond all hope of
release.</p>
<p>I mumbled some politeness in answer to his unanswerable opening,
and started the one possible topic of the weather. I was grossly
ignorant of the general requirements of agriculture in that or any
other connection, but any one knows a farmer wants fine weather for
harvest.</p>
<p>He took me up with a slightly exaggerated air of relief, and I
dare say we could have kept the subject going for ten minutes if it
had been necessary, but he had hardly begun his reply before the
three women for whom we had been waiting came into the room
together.</p>
<p>When I met Mr. Banks I felt, at once, that I might have inferred
him with nice accuracy from what I already knew of him. Mrs. Banks
was a surprise. I had pictured her as tall and slight, and inclined
to be sombre. Anne&rsquo;s hints of the romantic side of her
mother&rsquo;s temperament had, for some reason, suggested that
image to me, and I was quite absurdly dumfounded for the moment
when I saw this little, roundabout, dark-haired Frenchwoman, as
typically exotic as her husband was home-grown, voluble, brisk
despite the handicap of her figure, and with nothing English about
her unless it were her accent.</p>
<p>Fortunately she gave me no time to display the awkwardness of my
surprise. She came straight at me, talking from the instant she
entered the door. &ldquo;Discussing the crops already?&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;You must forgive us, Mr. Melhuish, for being so
interested in the weather. When one&rsquo;s fortune depends upon
it, one naturally thinks of little else.&rdquo; She gave me her
small plump hand with an engaging but, as it were, a breathless
smile. &ldquo;And you must be starving,&rdquo; she continued
rapidly. &ldquo;Anne tells me you had no tea at all anywhere, and
that the people at the Hall have been treating you outrageously.
So! will you sit there and Anne next to you, and those two dreadful
children who won&rsquo;t be separated, together on the other
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was apparently intent only upon this business of getting us
into our places about the supper-table, and not until I had sat
down did I realise that her last sentence had been an announcement
intended for her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say, Nancy?&rdquo; he asked with a puzzled
air. He was still standing at the head of the table and staring
with obvious embarrassment at his wife.</p>
<p>She waved her hands at him. &ldquo;Sit down, Alfred,&rdquo; she
commanded him, and in her pronunciation of his name I noticed for
the first time the ripple of a French &ldquo;r.&rdquo; Possibly her
manner of speaking his name was a form of endearment. &ldquo;All in
good time, you shall hear about it directly. Now, we are all very
hungry and waiting for you.&rdquo; And without the least hint of a
pause she turned to me and glided over an apology for the nature of
the meal. &ldquo;We call it supper,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and it
is just a farm-house supper, but better in its way, don&rsquo;t you
think, than a formal dinner?&rdquo; She took me utterly into her
confidence with her smile as she added, &ldquo;Up at the Hall they
make so much ceremony, all about nothing. I am not surprised that
you ran away. But it was very original, all the same.&rdquo; She
introduced me to the first course without taking breath,
&ldquo;Eggs and bacon. So English. Isn&rsquo;t there a story of a
man who starved to death on a walking-tour because he could no
longer endure to eat eggs and bacon? And when you have eaten
something you must tell us what you have all four been doing while
my husband and I were away. So far as I can understand you have
turned the universe completely inside out. We came back believing
that we return to the Farm, but I think it has become a
Fortress&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ventured a glance at her husband. These flickering allusions
of hers to the tragedy that was threatening him, seemed to me
indiscreet and rather too frivolous. But when I saw his look of
puzzled wonder and admiration, I began to appreciate the subtlety
and wisdom of her method. Using me as a convenient intermediary,
she was breaking the news by what were, to him, almost
inappreciable degrees. He took in her hints so slowly. He was not
sure from moment to moment whether or not she was in earnest.
Nevertheless, I recognised, I thought, at least one cause for
perturbation. He had been perceptibly ruffled and uneasy at the
reference to an understanding between his son and Brenda. Probably
the fear of that complication had been in his mind for some time
past.</p>
<p>Mrs. Banks had slid away to the subject of local scenery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is beautiful in its own way,&rdquo; she was saying,
&ldquo;but I feel with Arthur that it has an air of being
so&mdash;preserved. It is so proper, well-adjusted, I forget the
English word &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suggested &ldquo;trim&rdquo; as a near translation of
&ldquo;propre&rdquo; and &ldquo;bien-ajust&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trim, yes,&rdquo; she agreed enthusiastically. &ldquo;My
daughter tells me you are an author. There are three lime trees in
the pasture and the cattle have eaten the branches as high as they
can reach, so that now the trees have the precise shape of a bell.
Even the trees in the Park, you see, are trim&mdash;not, it is
true, like Versailles, where the poor things are made to grow
according to plan&mdash;but all the county is one great landscape
garden; all of England, nearly. Don&rsquo;t you agree with me? One
feels that there must always be a game-keeper or a policeman just
round the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited for my answer this time, and something in the
eagerness of her expression begged me to play up to her lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know exactly what you mean,&rdquo; I said, intensely
aware of Anne&rsquo;s proximity. &ldquo;I was thinking something of
the same kind, only this evening, when I went to meet Arthur in the
wood. He and I were discussing it, too, as we came back. That sense
of everything belonging to some one else, of having no right,
hardly the right to breathe without the Jervaises&rsquo;
permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her gesture finally confirmed the fact that perfect confidence
was established between us. I felt as if she had patted my
shoulder. But she may have been afraid that I might blunder into
too obvious a statement, if I were permitted to continue, for she
abruptly changed her tactics by saying to Brenda,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you ran away in the middle of the dance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;d finished dancing, as a matter of
fact,&rdquo; Brenda explained.</p>
<p>Mr. Banks shifted uneasily in his chair. &ldquo;Ran away, Miss
Brenda?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Did you say you&rsquo;d run
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flattered him with a look that besought his approval.
&ldquo;I simply couldn&rsquo;t stand it any longer,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll be going back?&rdquo; he returned, after
a moment&rsquo;s pause.</p>
<p>She shook her head, still regarding him attentively with an air
of appeal that implied submission to his judgment.</p>
<p>He had stopped eating, and now pushed his chair back a little
from the table as though he needed more space to deal with this
tremendous problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be getting us into trouble, Miss
Brenda,&rdquo; he warned her gravely. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do
for us to keep you here, if they&rsquo;re wanting you to go back
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Alfred, we&rsquo;ve as much right to her as they
have,&rdquo; Mrs. Banks put in.</p>
<p>The effect upon him of that simple speech was quite remarkable.
He opened his fine blue eyes and stared at his wife with a blank
astonishment that somehow conveyed an impression of fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy! Nancy!&rdquo; he expostulated in a tone that
besought her to say no more.</p>
<p>She laughingly waved her hands at him, using the same gesture
with which she had commanded him to sit down. &ldquo;Oh!
we&rsquo;ve got to face it, Alfred,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Arthur
and Brenda believe they&rsquo;re in love with one another, and
that&rsquo;s all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banks shook his head solemnly, but it seemed to me that his
manner expressed relief rather than the added perturbation I had
expected. &ldquo;No, no, it won&rsquo;t do. That&rsquo;d never
do,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been afraid of this, Miss
Brenda,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;but you must see for yourself
that it&rsquo;d never do&mdash;our position being what it is. Your
father&rsquo;d never hear of such a thing; and you&rsquo;d get us
all into trouble with him if he thought we&rsquo;d been encouraging
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew in his chair and returned to his supper as if he
regarded the matter as being now definitely settled. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what Mr. Melhuish will be thinking of us,&rdquo;
he added as an afterthought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Mr. Melhuish is on our side,&rdquo; Mrs. Banks
returned gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy! Nancy!&rdquo; he reproved her. &ldquo;This is too
serious a matter to make a joke about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was watching Mrs. Banks, and saw the almost invisible lift of
the eyebrows with which she passed on the conduct of the case to
Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother isn&rsquo;t joking, dear,&rdquo; Anne said,
accepting the signal without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation.
&ldquo;Really serious things have been happening while you were
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father frowned and shook his head. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t
the place to discuss them,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, father, I&rsquo;m afraid we must discuss them very
soon,&rdquo; Anne returned; &ldquo;because Mr. Jervaise might be
coming up after supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jervaise? Coming here?&rdquo; Banks&rsquo;s tone of
dismay showed that he was beginning, however slowly, to appreciate
the true significance of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t know that he is,&rdquo; Arthur put
in. &ldquo;I just thought it was possible he and Mr. Frank might
come up this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will certainly come. Have no doubt of that,&rdquo;
Mrs. Banks remarked.</p>
<p>The old man turned to his son as if seeking a refuge from the
intrigues of his adored but incomprehensible womenfolk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; he asked brusquely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To take her back to the Hall,&rdquo; Arthur said with the
least possible inclination of his head towards Brenda.</p>
<p>Banks required a few seconds to ponder that, and his wife and
daughter waited in silence for his reply. I had a sense of them as
watching over, and at once sheltering and directing him.
Nevertheless, though I admired their gentle deftness, I think that
at that point of the discussion some forcible male element in me
sided very strongly with old Banks. I was aware of the pressure
that was so insensibly surrounding him as of a subtly entangling
web that seemed to offer no resistance, and yet was slowly
smothering him in a million intricate intangible folds. And, after
all, why should he be torn away from his root-holds, exiled to some
forlorn unknown country where his very methods of farming would be
inapplicable? Brenda and Arthur were young and capable. Let them
wait, at least until she came of age. Let her be tried by an ordeal
of patient resistance. If she were worthy she could fight her
family for those thirteen months and win her own triumph without
injuring poor Banks.</p>
<p>And whether because I had communicated my thought to her by some
change of attitude or because she intuitively shared my sympathy
for her father, Anne turned to me just before she spoke, with a
quick little, impatient gesture as if beseeching me not to
interfere. I submitted myself to her wish with a distinct feeling
of pleasure, but made no application of my own joy in serving her
to the case of her father.</p>
<p>He was speaking again, now, with a solemn perplexity, as if he
were confusedly challenging the soft opposition of his
women&rsquo;s influence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, of course, she must go back to the Hall,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t like to get us into trouble, would
you, Miss Brenda? You see,&rdquo; he pushed his chair back once
more, in the throes of his effort to explain himself, &ldquo;your
father would turn me out, if there was any fuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was going on, but his wife, with a sudden magnificent
violence, scattered the web she and her daughter had been
weaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that might be the best thing that could happen to us,
Alfred,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m so sick and tired of
these foolish Jervaises. They are like the green fly on the rose
trees. They stick there and do nothing but suck the life out of us.
You are a free man. You owe them nothing. Let us break with them
and go out, all of us, to Canada with Arthur and Brenda. As for me,
I would rejoice to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy! Nancy!&rdquo; he reproached her for the third
time, with a humouring shake of his head. They were past the
celebration of their silver wedding, but it was evident that he
still saw in her the adorable foolishness of one who would never be
able to appreciate the final infallibility of English standards. He
loved her, he would make immense personal sacrifices for her, but
in these matters she was still a child, a foreigner. Just so might
he have reproached Anne at three years old for some infantile
naughtiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may come to that,&rdquo; Arthur interjected,
gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking like a fool, Arthur,&rdquo; his
father said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d I do at my age&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be
sixty-one next month&mdash;trapesing off to Canada?&rdquo; He felt
on safer ground, more sure of his authority in addressing his son.
He was English. He might be rebellious and need chastisement, but
he would not be swayed by these whimsical notions that sometimes
bewitched his mother and sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, father, we may <em>have</em> to go,&rdquo; Anne
softly reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to? Have to?&rdquo; he repeated, with a new note of
irritability sounding in his voice. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been
doing anything foolish, has he? Nothing as can&rsquo;t be got
over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was his wife who replied to that. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had our
time, Alfred,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We have to think of them now.
We must not be selfish. They are young and deeply in love, as you
and I were once. We cannot separate them because we are too lazy to
move. And sixty? Yes, it is true that you are sixty, but you are
strong and your heart is still young. It is not as if you were an
old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur and Brenda looked acutely self-conscious. Brenda blushed
and seemed inclined to giggle. Arthur&rsquo;s face was set in the
stern lines of one who hears his own banns called in church.</p>
<p>Banks leaned back in his chair and stared apprehensively at his
wife. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye mean it, Nancy&hellip;?&rdquo; he asked,
and something in his delivery of the phrase suggested that he had
come down to a familiar test of decision. I could only infer that
whenever she had confessed to &ldquo;meaning it&rdquo; in the past,
her request had never so far been denied. I guessed, also, that
until now she had never been outrageous in her demands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else can be done, dear?&rdquo; she replied gently.
&ldquo;There is no choice otherwise, except for them to
separate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at the culprits with an expression of bewilderment.
Why should their little love affair be regarded as being of such
tragic consequence, he seemed to ask. What did they mean to him and
his wife and daughter? Why should they be considered worthy of what
he could only picture as a supreme, and almost intolerable
sacrifice? These young people were always having love affairs.</p>
<p>He thrust his inquiry bluntly at Brenda. &ldquo;Are you in
earnest, then, Miss Brenda?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you
tell me that you want to marry him&mdash;that you&rsquo;re set on
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to marry him whatever happens,&rdquo; Brenda
replied in a low voice. She was still abashed by this public
discussion of her secrets. And it was probably with some idea of
diverting him from this intimate probing of her desires that she
continued more boldly. &ldquo;We would go off together, without
your consent, you know, if we thought it would do any good. But it
wouldn&rsquo;t, would it? They&rsquo;d probably be more spiteful
still, if we did that. Even if they could keep it dark,
they&rsquo;d never let you stay on here. But do you really think it
would be so awful for us all to go to Canada together? It&rsquo;s a
wrench, of course, but I expect it would be frightfully jolly when
we got there. Arthur says it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned from her with the least hint of contempt to look at
his son. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lost <em>your</em> place
a&rsquo;ready, I suppose?&rdquo; he said, trying to steady himself
by some familiar contact, an effort that would have been absurd if
it had not been so pathetic.</p>
<p>Arthur nodded, as stolid as an owl.</p>
<p>His father continued to search him with the same half-bewildered
stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, then?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She and I are going back, whatever happens.&rdquo; Arthur
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose they won&rsquo;t let her go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to!&rdquo; Banks recited, raising his voice at the
repetition of this foolish phrase. &ldquo;And how in the world are
you going to make &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jervaises aren&rsquo;t everybody,&rdquo; Arthur
growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find they&rsquo;re a sight too strong for
the like of us to go against,&rdquo; Banks affirmed
threateningly.</p>
<p>Arthur looked stubborn and shook his head. &ldquo;They
aren&rsquo;t what you think they are, father,&rdquo; he began, and
then, seeing the incredulity on the old man&rsquo;s face, he went
on in a slightly raised voice, &ldquo;Well, I know they
aren&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve been up there twice to-day. I saw Mr.
Jervaise this morning; went to the front door and asked for him,
and when I saw him I put it to him straight that I meant
to&mdash;that we were going to get married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; murmured Banks in an undertone of grieved
dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, father,&rdquo; Arthur proceeded; &ldquo;and if it
hadn&rsquo;t been for young Mr. Frank, we&rsquo;d have come to some
sort of understanding. Mr. Jervaise didn&rsquo;t actually say
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; as it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you went up again this evening?&rdquo; Banks prompted
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I only saw Mr. Frank, then,&rdquo; Arthur replied,
&ldquo;and he was in such a pad, there was no talking to him. Anne
can tell you why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banks did not speak but he turned his eyes gravely to his
daughter.</p>
<p>Anne lifted her head with the movement of one who decides to
plunge and be done with it. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d been making love to
me in the morning,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and I&mdash;played with
him for Arthur&rsquo;s sake. I thought it might help, and
afterwards I showed him that I&rsquo;d been letting him make a fool
of himself for nothing, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man made no audible comment, but his head drooped a
little forward and his body seemed to shrink a little within the
sturdy solidity of his oak armchair. Anne, also, had betrayed him.
Perhaps, he looked forward and saw the Home Farm without
Anne&mdash;she could not stay after that&mdash;and realised that
the verdict of his destiny was finally pronounced.</p>
<p>I turned my eyes away from him, and I think the others, too,
feigned some preoccupation that left him a little space of
solitude. We none of us spoke, and I knew by the sound of the quick
intake of her breath that Mrs. Banks was on the verge of
weeping.</p>
<p>I looked up, almost furtively, when I heard the crash of
footsteps on the gravel outside, and I found that the other three
with the same instinctive movement of suspense were turning towards
Mrs. Banks.</p>
<p>She dabbed at her eyes with her handkerchief and nodded to Anne,
a nod that said plainly enough, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s them&mdash;the
Jervaises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then we were all startled by the sound of the rude and
unnecessary violence of their knock at the front door. No doubt,
Frank was still &ldquo;in a pad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet no one moved until the old man at the head of the table
looked up with a deep sigh, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d better come in and be done with it,
Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His glance was slowly travelling round the room as if he were
bidding those familiar things a reluctant farewell. All his life
had been lived in that house.</p>
<h3 class="title"><a name="Ch_XIV" id="Ch_XIV"></a>XIV</h3>
<h2>Mrs. Banks</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The insulting attack upon the front door was made again with
even greater violence while we still waited, united, as I believe,
in one sympathetic resolve to shield the head of the house from any
unnecessary distress. He alone was called upon to make sacrifice;
it was our single duty and privilege to encircle and protect him.
And if my own feelings were representative, we fairly bristled with
resentment when this vulgar demand for admittance was repeated.
These domineering, comfortable, respectability-loving Jervaises
were the offenders; the sole cause of our present anxiety. We had a
bitter grievance against them and they came swaggering and
bullying, as if the threat to their silly prestige were the
important thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Banks said with
a nod to Anne. The little woman&rsquo;s eyes were bright with the
eagerness for battle, but she continued to talk automatically on
absurdly immaterial subjects to relieve the strain of even those
few seconds of waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our maid is out, you see, Mr. Melhuish,&rdquo; she
explained quickly, and turning to Brenda, continued without a
pause, &ldquo;So Anne has even had to lend you a dress.
You&rsquo;re about of a height, but you&rsquo;re so much slighter.
Still, with very little alteration, her things would fit you very
well. If we should be obliged &hellip;&rdquo; She broke off
abruptly as Anne returned, followed by Mr. Jervaise and the
glowering, vindictive figure of his son.</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s manner of entrance alone would have been sufficient
to demonstrate her attitude to the intruders, but she elected to
make it still more unmistakable by her announcement of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jervaises, mother,&rdquo; she said, with a
supercilious lift of her head. She might have been saying that the
men had called for the rent.</p>
<p>Little Mrs. Banks looked every inch an aristocrat as she
received them. The gesture of her plump little white hands as she
indicated chairs was almost regal in its authority.</p>
<p>Old Jervaise, obviously nervous, accepted the invitation, but
Frank, after closing the door, stood leaning with his back against
it. The position gave him command of the whole room, and at the
same time conveyed a general effect of threat. His attitude said,
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve got you, and none of you shall leave the
room until you&rsquo;ve paid in full for your impertinence.&rdquo;
I had guessed from his knock that he had finally put his weakness
for Anne away from him. He was clever enough to realise just how
and why she had fooled him. His single object, now, was
revenge.</p>
<p>Banks brooded, rather neglected and overlooked in a corner by
the window. He appeared to have accepted his doom as assured, and
being plunged into the final gulf of despair, he had, now, no heart
even to be apologetic. The solid earth of his native country was
slipping away from him; nothing else mattered.</p>
<p>There was one brief, tense interval of silence before old
Jervaise began to speak. We all waited for him to state the case;
Frank because he meant to reserve himself for the dramatic moment;
we others because we preferred to throw the onus of statement upon
him. (I do believe that throughout that interview it is fair to
speak of &ldquo;we others,&rdquo; of the whole six of us, almost as
of a single mind with a single intention. We played our individual
parts in our own manners, but we were subject to a single will
which was, I firmly believe, the will of Mrs. Banks. Even her
husband followed her lead, if he did it with reluctance, while the
rest of us obeyed her with delight.)</p>
<p>Old Jervaise fumbled his opening. He looked pale and tired, as
if he would be glad to be out of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have called,&rdquo; he began, striving for an effect
of magisterial gravity; &ldquo;we have come here, Mrs. Banks, to
fetch my daughter. I understand that you&rsquo;ve been away from
home&mdash;you and your husband&mdash;and you&rsquo;re probably not
aware of what has taken&mdash;has been going on in your
absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, we know,&rdquo; Mrs. Banks put in
disconcertingly. She was sitting erect and contemptuous in her
chair at the foot of the table. For one moment something in her
pose reminded me of Queen Victoria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed? You have heard; since your return?&rdquo;
faltered old Jervaise. &ldquo;But I cannot suppose for one moment
that either you or your husband approve of&mdash;of your
son&rsquo;s gross misbehaviour.&rdquo; He got out the accusation
with an effort; he had to justify himself before his son. But the
slight stoop of his shoulders, and his hesitating glances at Mrs.
Banks were propitiatory, almost apologetic. It seemed to me that he
pleaded with her to realise that he could say and do no less than
what he was saying and doing; to understand and to spare him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is new to me,&rdquo; Mrs. Banks replied.
&ldquo;I have heard nothing of any gross misbehaviour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was so clearly mistress of the situation that I might have
been sorry for old Jervaise, if it had not been for the presence of
that scowling fool by the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I can describe your son&rsquo;s
conduct as&mdash;as nothing less than gross misbehaviour,&rdquo;
the old man stammered, &ldquo;having consideration to his
employment. But, perhaps, you have not been properly informed of
the&mdash;of the offence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it an offence to love unwisely, Mr. Jervaise?&rdquo;
Mrs. Banks shot at him with a sudden ferocity.</p>
<p>He blustered feebly. &ldquo;You <em>must</em> see how impossible
it is for your son to dream of marrying my daughter,&rdquo; he
said. The blood had mounted to his face; and he looked as if he
longed to get up and walk out. I wondered vaguely whether Frank had
had that eventuality in mind when he blockaded the door with his
own gloomy person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tchah!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Banks with supreme
contempt. &ldquo;Do not talk that nonsense to me, but listen, now,
to what I have to say. I will make everything quite plain to you.
We have decided that Arthur and Brenda shall be married; but we
condescend to that amiable weakness of yours which always demands
that there shall be no scandal. It must surely be your motto at the
Hall to avoid scandal&mdash;at any cost. So we are agreed to make a
concession. The marriage we insist upon; but we are willing, all of
us, to emigrate. We will take ourselves away, so that no one can
point to the calamity of a marriage between a Banks and a Jervaise.
It will, I think, break my husband&rsquo;s heart, but we see that
there is nothing else to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Jervaise&rsquo;s expression was certainly one of relief. He
would, I am sure, have agreed to that compromise if he had been
alone; he might even have agreed, as it was, if he had been given
the chance. But Frank realised his father&rsquo;s weakness not less
surely than we did, and although this was probably not the precise
moment he would have chosen, he instantly took the case into his
own hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! no, Mrs. Banks, certainly not,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;In the first place we did not come here to bargain with you,
and in the second it must be perfectly plain to you that the
scandal remains none the less because you have all gone away. We
have come to fetch my sister home, that&rsquo;s the only thing that
concerns you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if she will not go with you?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Banks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must,&rdquo; Frank returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And still, if she will not go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we shall bring an action against you for abducting
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Banks smiled gently and pursed her mouth &ldquo;To avoid a
scandal?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you persist in your absurd demands, there will be a
scandal in any case,&rdquo; Frank replied curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose my wishes don&rsquo;t count at all?&rdquo;
Brenda put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Frank said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, look here, father,&rdquo; Brenda continued, turning
to old Jervaise; &ldquo;<em>why</em> do you want me to come back?
We&rsquo;ve never got on, I and the rest of you. <em>Why</em>
can&rsquo;t you let me go and be done with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jervaise fidgeted uneasily and looked up with a touch of appeal
at his son. He had begun to mumble some opening when Frank
interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
that&rsquo;s the end of it. There&rsquo;s nothing more to be said.
I&rsquo;ve told you precisely how the case stands. Either you come
back with us without a fuss, or we shall begin an action at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know now that Frank Jervaise was merely bluffing, and that
they could have had no case, since Brenda was over eighteen, and
was not being detained against her will. But none of us, probably
not even old Jervaise himself, knew enough of the law to question
the validity of the threat.</p>
<p>Little Mrs. Banks, however, was not depending on her legal
knowledge to defeat her enemies. What woman would? She had been
exchanging glances with her husband during the brief interval in
which she had entrusted a minor plea to her junior, and I suppose
she, now, considered herself free to produce her trump card. Banks
had turned his back on the room&mdash;perhaps the first time he had
ever so slighted his landlord and owner&mdash;and was leaning his
forehead against the glass of the window. His attitude was that of
a man who had no further interest in such trivialities as this
bickering and scheming. Perhaps he was dimly struggling to
visualise what life in Canada might mean for him?</p>
<p>His wife&rsquo;s eyes were still shining with the zest of her
present encounter. She was too engrossed by that to consider just
then the far heavier task she would presently have to undertake.
She shrugged her shoulders and made a gesture with her hands that
implied the throwing of all further responsibility upon her
antagonists. &ldquo;If you will have it,&rdquo; she seemed to say,
&ldquo;you must take the consequences.&rdquo; And old Jervaise, at
all events, foresaw what was coming, and at that eleventh hour made
one last effort to avert it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Frank&hellip;&rdquo; he began, but Mrs. Banks
interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is useless, Mr. Jervaise,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr.
Frank has been making love to my daughter and she has shown him
plainly how she despises him. After that he will not listen to you.
He seeks his revenge. It is the manner of your family to make love
in that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impertinence will not make things any easier for you,
Mrs. Banks,&rdquo; Frank interpolated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impertinence? From me to you?&rdquo; the little woman
replied magnificently. &ldquo;Be quiet, boy, you do not know what
you are saying. My husband and I have saved your poor little family
from disgrace for twenty years, and I would say nothing now, if it
were not that you have compelled me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw one glance of contempt at old Jervaise, who was
leaning forward with his hand over his mouth, as if he were in
pain, and then continued,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is as well that you should know the truth, and
after all, the secret remains in good keeping. And you understand
that it is apropos to that case you are threatening. It might be as
well for you to know before you bring that case against
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; urged Frank sardonically. He was, I think,
the one person in the room who was not tense with expectation.
Nothing but physical fear could penetrate that hide of his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Frank,&rdquo; she did not deign to imitate him,
but she took up his word as if it were a challenge. &ldquo;Well, it
is as well for you to know that Brenda is not your mother&rsquo;s
daughter.&rdquo; She turned as she spoke to Brenda herself, with a
protective gesture of her little hand. &ldquo;I know it will not
grieve you, dear, to hear that,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;It is
not as if you were so attached to them all at the
Hall&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who, then&hellip;?&rdquo; Brenda began, evidently too
startled by this astonishing news to realise its true
significance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was my step-sister, Claire S&eacute;v&eacute;rac,
dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Banks explained. &ldquo;She was Olive&rsquo;s
governess. Oh! poor Claire, how she suffered! It was, perhaps, a
good thing after all that she died so soon after you were born. Her
heart was broken. She was so innocent; she could not realise that
she was no more than a casual mistress for your father. And then
Mrs. Jervaise, whom you have believed to be your mother, was very
unkind to my poor Claire. Yet it seemed best just then, in her
trouble, that she should go away to Italy, and that it should be
pretended that you were Mrs. Jervaise&rsquo;s true daughter. I
arranged that. I have blamed myself since, but I did not understand
at the time that Mrs. Jervaise consented solely that she might keep
you in sight of your father as a reminder of his sin. She was
spiteful, and at that time she had the influence. She threatened a
separation if she was not allowed to have her own way. So! the
secret was kept and there were so few who remember my poor Claire
that it is only Alfred and I who know how like her you are, my
dear. She had not, it is true, your beautiful fair hair that is so
striking with your dark eyes. But your temperament, yes. She, too,
was full of spirit, vivacious, gay&mdash;until
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused with a deep sigh, and I think we all sighed with her
in concert. She had held us with her narrative. She had, as a
matter of fact, told us little enough and that rather allusively,
but I felt that I knew the whole history of the unhappy Claire
S&eacute;v&eacute;rac. Anne had not overrated her mother&rsquo;s
powers in this direction. And my sigh had in it an element of
relief. Some strain had been mercifully relaxed.</p>
<p>The sound of Frank&rsquo;s harsh voice came as a gross intrusion
on our silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What evidence have you got of all this?&rdquo; he asked,
but the ring of certainty had gone from his tone.</p>
<p>Mrs. Banks pointed with a superb gesture at his father.</p>
<p>The old man was leaning forward in his chair with his face in
his hands. There was no spirit in him. Probably he was thinking
less of the present company than of Claire
S&eacute;v&eacute;rac.</p>
<p>Frank Jervaise showed his true quality on that occasion. He
looked down at his father with scowling contempt, stared for a
moment as if he would finally wring the old man&rsquo;s soul with
some expression of filial scorn, and then flung himself out of the
room, banging the door behind him as a proclamation that he finally
washed his hands of the whole affair.</p>
<p>Old Jervaise looked up when the door banged and rose rather
feebly to his feet. For a moment he looked at Arthur, as though he
were prepared, now, to meet even that more recent impeachment of
his virtue which he had feared earlier in the day. But
Arthur&rsquo;s face gave no sign of any vindictive intention, and
the old man silently followed his son, creeping out with the air of
a man who submissively shoulders the burden of his disgrace.</p>
<p>I had been sorry for him that morning, but I was still sorrier
for him then. Banks was suffering righteously and might find relief
in that knowledge, but this man was reaping the just penalties of
his own acts.</p>

<h2>Remembrance</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>I do not believe that any of them saw me leave the room.</p>
<p>As soon as old Jervaise had gone, all of them had turned with an
instinct of protection towards the head of the family. He, alone,
had been sacrificed. Within an hour his whole life had been
changed, and I began to doubt, as Anne had doubted, whether so old
a tree would bear transplanting. Whatever tenderness and care could
do, would be done for him, but the threat of uprooting had come so
suddenly. In any case, I could not help those gentle foresters
whose work it would be to conduct the critical operation; and I
walked out of the room without offering any perfunctory excuse for
leaving them.</p>
<p>I made my way into the garden by the side door through which I
had first entered the Home Farm; and after one indeterminate
moment, came to a halt at the gate on the slope of the hill. I did
not want to go too far from the house. For the time being I was no
more to the Banks than an inconvenient visitor, but I hoped that
presently some of them&mdash;I put it that way to
myself&mdash;would miss me, and that Arthur or Anne would come and
tell me what had been arranged in my absence. I should have been
glad to talk over the affair with Arthur, but I hoped that it would
not be Arthur who would come to find me.</p>
<p>For a time my thoughts flickered capriciously over the
astonishing events of my adventurous week-end. I was pleasantly
replete with experience. In all my life I had never before entered
thus completely into any of the great movements of life. I recalled
my first thrills of anticipation amidst the glowing, excited youth
of the resting dancers at the Hall. We had been impatient for
further expression. The dragging departure of the Sturtons had been
an unbearable check upon the exuberance of our desires. In my
thought of the scene I could see the unspent spirit of our vitality
streaming up in a fierce fount of energy.</p>
<p>And with me, at least, that fount, unexpectedly penned by the
first hints of disaster, had still played furiously in my mind as I
had walked with Frank Jervaise through the wood. My intoxicated
imagination had created its own setting. I had gone, exalted, to
meet my wonderful fate. Through some strange scene of my own making
I had strayed to the very feet of enduring romance.</p>
<p>But after that exciting prelude, when the moon had set and slow
dawn, like a lifting curtain, had been drawn to reveal the
landscape of a world outside the little chamber of my own being, I
had been cast from my heights of exaltation into a gloomy pit of
disgrace. Fate, with a fastidious particularity, had hauled me back
to the things of everyday. I was not to be allowed to dream too
long. I was wanted to play my part in this sudden tragedy of
experience.</p>
<p>My thought went off at a tangent when I reached that point of my
reflection. I had found myself involved in the Banks&rsquo;s drama,
but what hope had I of ever seeing them again after the next day?
What, moreover, was the great thing I was called upon to do? I had
decided only an hour or two before that my old way of life had
become impossible for me, but equally impossible was any way of
life that did not include the presence of Anne.</p>
<p>I looked at my watch, and found that it was after ten
o&rsquo;clock, but how long I had been standing at the gate, I had
no idea; whether an hour or ten minutes. I had been dreaming again,
lost in imaginative delights; until the reminder of this new
urgency had brought me back to a reality that demanded from me an
energy of participation and of initiative.</p>
<p>I wished that Anne would come&mdash;and by way of helping her
should she, indeed, have come out to look for me, I strolled back
to the Farm, and then round to the front of the house.</p>
<p>The windows of the sitting-room had been closed but the blinds
were not drawn. The lamp had been lit and splayed weak fans of
yellow light on to the gravel, and the flower-beds of the grass
plot. The path of each beam was picked out from the diffused
radiance of the moonlight, by the dancing figures of the moths that
gathered and fluttered across the prisms of these enchanted rays.
But I did not approach the windows. In the stillness of the night I
could hear Anne&rsquo;s clear musical voice. She was still there in
the sitting-room, still soothing and persuading her father. Her
actual words were indistinguishable, but the modulations of her
tone seemed to convey the sense of her speech, as a melody may
convey the ideas of form and colour.</p>
<p>I returned to my vigil at the gate and to thoughts of
Anne&mdash;to romantic thoughts of worship and service; of becoming
worthy of her regard; of immense faithfulness to her image when
confronted with the most provocative temptations; to thoughts of
self-sacrifice and bravado, of humility and boasting; of some
transcending glorification of myself that should make me worthy of
her love.</p>
<p>I was arrested in the midst of my ecstatic sentimentalism by the
sight of the Hall, the lights of which were distantly visible
through the trees. The path by the wood was not the direct line
from the Hall to the Farm; the sanctities of the Park were not
violated by any public right of way. The sight of the place pulled
me up, because I was suddenly pierced by the reflection that
perhaps old Jervaise had thus postured to win the esteem of his
daughter&rsquo;s governess. He, it is true, had had dignity and
prestige on his side, but surely he must have condescended to win
her. Had he, too, dreamed dreams of sacrifice at the height of his
passion? Had he alternately grovelled and strutted to attract the
admiration of his lady? I found the reflection markedly
distasteful. I was sorry again, now, for the old man. He had
suffered heavy penalties for his lapse. I remembered Mrs.
Banks&rsquo;s hint that his wife had adopted Brenda in the first
place in order that he might have before him a constant reminder of
his disgrace. I could believe that. It was just such a piece of
chicane as I should expect from that timid hawk, Mrs. Jervaise. But
while I pitied the man, I could not look upon his furtive
gratifications of passion with anything but distaste.</p>
<p>No; if my love for Anne was to be worthy of so wonderful an
object, I must not stupefy myself with these vapours of romance.
The ideal held something finer than this, something that I could
not define, but that conveyed the notion, however indeterminately,
of equality. I thought of my fancy that we had
&ldquo;recognised&rdquo; each other the night before. Surely that
fancy contained the germ of the true understanding, of the
conceptions of affinity and remembrance.</p>
<p>No tie of our present earth life could be weighed against that
idea of a spirit love, enduring through the ages; a love
transcending and immortal, repeating itself in ever ascending
stages of rapture. The flesh was but a passing instrument of
temporal expression, a gross medium through which the spirit could
speak only in poor, inarticulate phrases of its magnificent
recognition of an eternal bond. &hellip; Oh! I was soon high in the
air again, riding my new Pegasus through the loftiest altitudes of
lonely exaltation. I was a conqueror while I had the world to
myself. But when at last I heard the rustle of a woman&rsquo;s
dress on the path behind me, I was nothing more than a shy,
self-conscious product of the twentieth century, all too painfully
aware of his physical shortcomings.</p>
<hr />
<p>She came and stood beside me at the gate, without speaking; and
my mind was so full of her, so intoxicated with the splendour of my
imaginings, that I thought she must surely share my newfound
certainty that we had met once more after an age of separation. I
waited, trembling, for her to begin. I knew that any word of mine
would inevitably precipitate the bathos of a civilised
conversation. I was incapable of expressing my own thought, but I
hoped that she, with her magic voice, might accomplish a miracle
that was beyond my feeble powers. Indeed, I could imaginatively
frame for her, speech that I could not, myself, deliver. I knew
what I wanted her to say&mdash;or to imply. For it was hardly
necessary for her to say anything. I was ready, wholly sympathetic
and receptive. If she would but give me the least sign that she
understood, I could respond, though I was so unable to give any
sign myself.</p>
<p>I came down from my clouds with a feeling of bitter
disappointment, a sense of waking from perfect dreams to the
realisation of a hard, inimical world, when she said in a formal
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s after eleven. My mother and father have gone
to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he&mdash;is he in any way reconciled?&rdquo; I asked,
and I think I tried to convey something of resentment by my tone. I
still believed that she must guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way,&rdquo; she said, and sighed rather wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been very hard for him to make up his mind
so quickly&mdash;to such a change,&rdquo; I agreed politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was easier than I expected,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He
was so practical. Just at first, of course, while Mr. Jervaise was
there, he seemed broken. I didn&rsquo;t know what we should do. I
was almost afraid that he would refuse to come. But afterwards
he&mdash;well, he squared his shoulders. He is magnificent.
He&rsquo;s as solid as a rock. He didn&rsquo;t once reproach us. He
seemed to have made up his mind; only one thing frightened
him&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; I asked, as she paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we haven&rsquo;t any capital to speak of,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Even after we have sold the furniture here, we
shan&rsquo;t have more than five or six hundred pounds so far as we
can make out. And he says it isn&rsquo;t enough. He says that he
and mother are too old to start again from small beginnings.
And&mdash;oh! a heap of practical things. He is so slow in some
ways that it startled us all to find out how shrewd he was about
this. It was his own subject, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There needn&rsquo;t be any difficulty about
capital,&rdquo; I said eagerly. I had hardly had patience for her
to finish her speech. From her first mention of that word
&ldquo;capital&rdquo; I had seen my chance to claim a right in the
Banks&rsquo;s fortunes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see&hellip;&rdquo; she began, and then
checked herself and continued stiffly, &ldquo;My father would never
accept help of any kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arthur might&mdash;from a friend,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks we&rsquo;ve got enough&mdash;to begin
with,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been arguing about
it. Arthur&rsquo;s young and certain. Father isn&rsquo;t either,
and he&rsquo;s afraid of going to a strange country&mdash;and
failing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in that case Arthur must give way,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Anne was silent for a moment and then said in a horribly formal
voice. &ldquo;Am I to understand, Mr. Melhuish, that you are
proposing to lend Arthur this money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On any terms he likes,&rdquo; I agreed warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not mistake her intention. I knew that she expected me
to say that it was for her sake. I was no less certain that if I
did say that she would snub me. Her whole tone and manner since she
had come out to the gate had challenged me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are alone in the moonlight,&rdquo; her attitude
had said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been trying to hint some kind of
admiration for me ever since we met. Now, let us get that over and
finished with, so that we can discuss this business of my
father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I like him,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
known him long, of course; only a few hours altogether;
but&hellip;&rdquo; I stopped because I was afraid she would think
that the continuation of the argument might be meant to apply to
her rather than to Arthur; and I had no intention of pleading by
innuendo. When I did speak, I meant to speak directly, and there
was but one thing I had to say. If that failed, I was ready to
admit that I had been suffering under a delusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she prompted me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you going to say that it wasn&rsquo;t how
long you&rsquo;d known a person that mattered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly didn&rsquo;t matter in Arthur&rsquo;s
case,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I liked him from the first moment I saw
him. It&rsquo;s true that we had been talking for some time before
there was light enough for me to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like him so much that you&rsquo;d be willing to lend
him all the money he wanted, without security?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, all the money I have,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without any&mdash;any sort of condition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should make one condition,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he&rsquo;d let me come and stay with him, and
Brenda, and all of you&mdash;on the farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, of course, we should all have to be very nice to
you, and treat you as our benefactor&mdash;our proprietor,
almost,&rdquo; she suggested cruelly.</p>
<p>I was hurt, and for a moment I was inclined to behave much as
young Turnbull had behaved that afternoon, to turn away and sulk,
and show that I had been grievously misunderstood. I overcame that
impulse, however. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t expect you to
curtsey!&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>She turned to me with one of her instant changes of mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell me the truth?&rdquo; she asked
passionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth <em>you</em> mean hasn&rsquo;t anything
whatever to do with what we&rsquo;re talking about now,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but it has. It must have,&rdquo; she protested.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you trying to buy my good-will all the time?
All this is so heroic and theatrical. Aren&rsquo;t you being the
splendid benefactor of one of your own plays&mdash;being
frightfully tactful and oh! <em>gentlemanly</em>? It wouldn&rsquo;t
be the right thing, of course, to&mdash;to put any sort of pressure
on me; but you could put us all under every sort of obligation to
you, and afterwards&mdash;when you came to stay with
us&mdash;you&rsquo;d be very forbearing and sad, no doubt, and be
very sweet to my mother&mdash;she likes you already&mdash;but every
one would know just why; and you&rsquo;d all expect
me&mdash;to&mdash;to do the right thing, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If I had not been truly in love with her I should have been
permanently offended by that speech. It stung me. What she implied
was woundingly true of that old self of mine which had so recently
come under my observation and censure. I could see that; and yet if
any one but Anne had accused me I should have gone off in high
dudgeon. The hint of red in my hair would not permit me to accept
insult with meekness. And while I was still seeking some way to
avoid giving expression to my old self whose influence was
painfully strong just then, she spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re offended,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>I avoided a direct answer by saying, &ldquo;What you accused me
of thinking and planning might have been true of me yesterday; it
isn&rsquo;t true, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you changed so much since yesterday?&rdquo; she
asked, as if she expected me to confess, now, quite in the familiar
manner. She had given me an opportunity for the proper
continuation. I refused it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only one claim on you,&rdquo; I said boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she replied impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You recognised me last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very like her not to fence over that. She had a dozen
possible equivocations, but she suddenly met me with no attempt at
disguise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <em>thought</em> I did,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just
for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now? You know&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned her elbows on the gate and stared out over the
moonlit mysteries of the Park.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a bit what I expected,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>I misunderstood her. &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; I
began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To look at,&rdquo; she interrupted me.</p>
<p>I felt a thrill of hope. &ldquo;But neither are you,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she commented softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had romantic visions, too,&rdquo; I went on;
&ldquo;of what she would look like when I did meet her. But when I
saw you, I remembered, and all the visions&mdash;oh! scattered;
vanished into thin air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t been so successful&hellip;&rdquo; she
murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for that,&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;m going to make amends. I realised it all this afternoon in
the wood when I went to meet Arthur. I&rsquo;m going to begin all
over again, now. I&rsquo;m coming to Canada&mdash;to work.&rdquo;
The whole solution of my problem was suddenly clear, although I had
not guessed it until that moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to buy a
farm for all of us,&rdquo; I went on quickly, &ldquo;and all the
money that&rsquo;s over, I shall give away. The hospitals are
always willing to accept money without asking why you give it.
They&rsquo;re not suspicious, <em>they</em> don&rsquo;t consider
themselves under any obligation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much should you have to give away?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty or forty thousand pounds,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It
depends on how much the farm costs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better keep a little, in case the farm
fails?&rdquo; she put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t fail,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;How could
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d do all that just because
you&rsquo;ve&mdash;remembered me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was another influence,&rdquo; I admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; she asked, with the sound of new
interest in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this affair with the Jervaises,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;It has made me hate the possession of money and the power
money gives. That farm of ours is going to be a communal farm. Our
workers shall have an interest in the profits. No one is to be the
proprietor. We&rsquo;ll all be one family&mdash;no scraping for
favours, or fears of dismissal; we&rsquo;ll all be equal and
free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer that, at once; and I had an unpleasant
feeling that she was testing my quality by some criterion of her
own, weighing the genuineness of my emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you feel like this about things this
afternoon?&rdquo; she asked, after what seemed to me an immense
interval.</p>
<p>I was determined to tell her nothing less than the truth.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I confessed, &ldquo;much of it was a result of
what you said to me. I&mdash;I had an illumination. You made me see
what a poor thing my life had been; how conventional, artificial,
worthless, it was. What you said about my plays was so true. I had
never realised it before&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t bothered to think
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember saying anything about your
plays,&rdquo; she interrupted me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you did,&rdquo; I assured her; &ldquo;very little;
nothing directly; but I knew what you felt, and when I came to
think it over, I agreed with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only seen <em>one</em>,&rdquo; she
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all the same,&rdquo; I assured her,
becoming fervent in my humility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why go to Canada?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Why not
try to write better plays?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I saw my whole life plainly, in the wood this
afternoon,&rdquo; was my reply. &ldquo;I did not know what to do
then. I couldn&rsquo;t see any answer to my problem. But when you
were speaking to me a minute ago, I realised the whole thing
clearly. I understood what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a form of conversion,&rdquo; I concluded
resolutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you mean it all&mdash;now,&rdquo; she
commented, as if she were speaking to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a question of <em>meaning</em>
anything,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;The experiences of this week-end
have put the whole social question in a new light for me. I could
never go back, now, to the old life. My conscience would always be
reproaching me, if I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re rich, and feel like that,
oughn&rsquo;t you to shoulder your responsibilities?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do something? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be rather like running
away to give your money to the hospitals and go to Canada to work
on a farm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my present impulse,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;And I mean to follow it. I don&rsquo;t know that I shall
want to stay in Canada for the rest of my life. I may see further
developments after I&rsquo;ve been there for a few years.
But&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she urged me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want to&mdash;to stay near you&mdash;all of you. I
can&rsquo;t tell you how I admire your father and mother and Arthur
and&mdash;all of you. And you see, I admit that this conversion of
mine has been very sudden. I&mdash;I want to learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you always follow your impulses like this?&rdquo; she
put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had one worth following before,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about wanting to fight Frank Jervaise?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;And running away from the Hall? And suddenly taking
Arthur&rsquo;s side in the row? and all those things? Didn&rsquo;t
you follow your impulses, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, it had never before occurred to me that I was
impulsive. I had imagined myself to be self-controlled, rather
business-like, practical. I was frankly astonished at this new
light on my character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I did, in a way,&rdquo; I admitted
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To say nothing of&hellip;&rdquo; she began, and stopped
with a little, rather embarrassed laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; I urged her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many times before have you imagined yourself to be
head over ears in love?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>I was repaid in that moment for all the self-denials and
fastidious shrinkings of my youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never once!&rdquo; I acclaimed triumphantly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the one common experience that has passed me by.
I&rsquo;ve often wondered why I could never fall in love.
I&rsquo;ve admired any number of women. I&rsquo;ve tried to fall in
love with them. And I have never been able to, try as I would. I
could deceive myself about other things, but never about that. Now,
I know why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I waited for her encouragement, but as she did not speak I went
on with more hesitation. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll think me a romantic
fool, I suppose, if I tell you why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I know, I know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
told me already in so many words. You mean that you&rsquo;ve been
waiting for me; that you <em>had</em> to wait for me. You&rsquo;ve
been very frank. You deserve some return. Shall I tell you just how
I feel? I will. I don&rsquo;t mind telling you the truth, too. I
did remember you last night. But not since; not even now. But I
like you&mdash;I like you very much&mdash;as you are this evening.
More than I&rsquo;ve ever liked any man before. And if you went
away, I should remember you; and want you to come back. But you
must give me time. Lots of time. Don&rsquo;t make love to me any
more; not yet; not till I&rsquo;ve really remembered. I think I
shall&mdash;in a little while&mdash;when you&rsquo;ve gone away.
You&rsquo;re so near me, now. And so <em>new</em>. You don&rsquo;t
belong to my life, yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused and then went on in another tone. &ldquo;But I
believe you&rsquo;re right about Canada. I&rsquo;ll explain it all
to the others. We&rsquo;ll make some kind of arrangement about it.
I expect it will have to be <em>your</em> farm, nominally, for a
time&mdash;until we all know you better. I can feel that you
do&mdash;that you have taken a tremendous fancy to all of us. I
felt it just now, after supper. I was watching you and&mdash;oh!
well, I knew what you were feeling about my father and mother; and
it seemed to be just what I should have liked you to feel. But I
don&rsquo;t think I would give <em>all</em> my money to the
hospitals, if I were you. Not without thinking it over a bit,
first. Wait until we get to Canada and see&mdash;how we get
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t trust my impulses,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>She laughed. &ldquo;Wait till to-morrow anyway,&rdquo; she
replied.</p>
<p>And as she spoke I heard far away, across the Park, the sound of
the stable-clock at the Hall, striking twelve. The artificial sound
of it was mellowed and altered by distance; as different from that
theatrical first striking I had noticed in the exciting atmosphere
of the crowd, as was my present state of mind from that in which I
had expectantly waited the coming of romance&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow begins now,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have to be up before six,&rdquo; she added, in the
formal voice she knew so well how to assume.</p>
<p>I felt as though she had by that one return to civility
cancelled all that she said, and as we turned back to the house, I
began to wonder whether the promise of my probation was as assured
as I had, a minute earlier, so confidently believed.</p>
<p>We were nearly at the little porch that would for ever be
associated in my mind with the fumbling figure of Frank Jervaise,
when she said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment. I&rsquo;ll get you something,&rdquo; and left
me standing in almost precisely the same spot from which I had
gazed up at her window the night before.</p>
<p>She returned almost immediately, but it was not until we were
inside the house and she had lighted my candle that she gave me the
&ldquo;something,&rdquo; pressing it into my hand with a sudden
delicious, girlish embarrassment.</p>
<p>She was gone before I recognised that the precious thing she had
given me was a sprig of Rosemary.</p>
<h3 class="title"><a id="Ch_PS" name="Ch_PS"></a>Postscript</h3>
<h2>The True Story</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>It was by the merest accident that we gathered that delightful
piece of information&mdash;on our first trip to England, not quite
three years after we were married.</p>
<p>I did not know that &ldquo;<em>The Mulberry Bush</em>&rdquo; had
been revived for a few weeks as a stop-gap, until we saw the boards
outside the theatre. Anne insisted that we should go in, and the
arbiters of coincidence ordained that I should take seats in the
stalls immediately behind one of those well-informed society women
who know the truth about everything.</p>
<p>We were somewhat amused by her omniscience during the first
interval, but it was not until the second that she came to the
priceless report of our own two selves.</p>
<p>I was not listening to her when she began, but Anne&rsquo;s
sudden grasp of my arm and the inclination of her head, awoke me to
the fact that the gossip just in front of us must, for some reason
or other, be instantly attended to.</p>
<p>There was a good deal of chatter going on in the auditorium and
I missed an occasional sentence here and there in addition to the
opening, but there could be no doubt as to the application of the
reminiscence I heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got himself into a scrape and had to leave the
country,&rdquo; was the first thing that reached me. &ldquo;As a
matter of fact I had the whole story from some one who was actually
staying in the house at the time.&rdquo; She dropped her voice as
she added something confidentially of which I only caught the sound
of the name Jervaise. Anne was squeezing my arm violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, his father&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; the gossip
continued in answer to a question from her companion. &ldquo;A
young man of great promise. He took silk last year, and is safe for
a place in the Cabinet sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Frank,&rdquo; Anne whispered.</p>
<p>I nodded and waited eagerly, although I had not, then, realised
my own connection with the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, that other affair was four years
ago&mdash;nothing to do with the dear Jervaises, except for the
unfortunate fact that they were entertaining him at the time. He
ran away with a farmer&rsquo;s daughter; eloped with her in the
middle of a dance the Jervaises were giving. Never seen her before
that evening, I believe. The father was one of the Jervaises&rsquo;
tenants&hellip;. A superior kind of young woman in some ways,
I&rsquo;ve heard; and a friend of the youngest Jervaise girl
&hellip; you wouldn&rsquo;t remember her &hellip; she went with her
friend to Australia or somewhere &hellip; some quixotic idea of
protecting her, I believe &hellip; and married out there. The
farmer&rsquo;s name was Baggs. The whole family were a trifle
queer, and emigrated afterwards &hellip; yes, it was a pity about
Melhuish, in a way. He was considered quite a promising young
dramatist. This thing of his was a distinct success. Very amusing.
But naturally, no one would receive him after he&rsquo;d married
this Baggs girl. Besides which &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at that point the orchestra began, the woman dropped her
voice again, and the only other fragment I heard was,
&ldquo;&hellip; after the disgraceful scene at the dance &hellip;
quite impossible&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at Anne and was surprised to find that she was white
with indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must tell them,&rdquo; she whispered passionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! no, please,&rdquo; I whispered back. &ldquo;They
wouldn&rsquo;t believe you. It would only add another shocking
detail to the next exposition of the scandal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Detestable people,&rdquo; she said, in a voice that must
have been heard by our gossip, although she evidently did not
realise the application of the description to herself and her
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be thankful,&rdquo; I whispered to Anne,
&ldquo;that I&rsquo;m no longer writing this sort of piffle to
amuse them. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two women had left the theatre before the end of the third
act, but long before that Anne had seen the humour of this true
story of our elopement.</p>

<h4>MAY SINCLAIR&rsquo;S NEW NOVEL</h4>
<h3>Mary Olivier: A Life</h3>
<p class="cen">BY MAY SINCLAIR,</p>
<p class="cen">Author of &ldquo;The Tree of Heaven,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p class="rgt">Cloth, 12mo.</p>
<p>No novel of the war period made a more profound impression than
did Miss Sinclair&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Tree of Heaven.&rdquo; The
announcement of a new book by this distinguished author is
therefore most welcome. &ldquo;Mary Olivier&rdquo; is a story in
Miss Sinclair&rsquo;s best manner. Once again she has chosen a
theme of vital interest and has treated it with the superb literary
skill which has put her among the really great of contemporary
novelists.</p>
<p>A woman&rsquo;s life, her thoughts, sensations and emotions
directly presented, without artificial narrative or analysis,
without autobiography.</p>
<p>The main interest lies in Mary Olivier&rsquo;s search for
Reality, her relations with her mother, father and three brothers,
and her final passage from the bondage of infancy, the conflicts of
childhood and adolescence, the disenchantments (and other
drawbacks) of maturity, to the freedom, peace and happiness of
middle-age.</p>
<p>The period covered is from 1865 when Mary is two years old to
1910 when she is forty-seven.</p>

<h4>EDEN PHILLPOTTS&rsquo; NEW NOVEL</h4>
<h3>Storm in a Teacup</h3>
<p class="cen">BY EDEN PHILLPOTTS</p>
<p class="cen">Author of &ldquo;The Spinners,&rdquo; &ldquo;Old
Delabole,&rdquo; &ldquo;Brunel&rsquo;s Towers,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p class="rgt"><em>Cloth, 12mo.</em></p>
<p>This carries on Mr. Phillpotts&rsquo; series of novels dealing
with the human side of the different industries. Here the art of
paper making furnishes the background. The theme is somewhat
humorous in nature. A young wife picks a quarrel with her husband
because he is commonplace, and elopes with a man of high
intellectual ability. Finding him, however, extremely prosaic and a
bore, she is glad in the end to return to her first love.</p>
<p>The elopement, it might be explained, was purely a nominal one,
carried out on a high moral basis with the most tender respect for
the lady&rsquo;s reputation and character. This fact leads to a
number of unusual and frequently amusing situations.</p>

<h3>From Father to Son</h3>
<p class="cen">BY MARY S. WATTS</p>
<p class="cen">Author of &ldquo;Nathan Burke,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Rise of Jennie Gushing,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Boardman Family,&rdquo;
etc.</p>
<p class="rgt"><em>Cloth, 12 mo.</em></p>
<p>The hero of Mrs. Watts&rsquo; new story is a young man belonging
to a very wealthy family, who has had every sort of luxury and
advantage and who, upon entering his father&rsquo;s office after
leaving college, finds that the huge fortune founded by his
grandfather was mainly made by profiteering on the
grandfather&rsquo;s part during the Civil War. The question is what
is this young man of the present day to do? He is high-minded and
sensitive and the problem is a difficult one. What, too, is his own
father to do&mdash;also a man of sterling character, though of a
sterner type. The theme which grows out of this situation is one of
singular interest and power and involves a moving crowd of
characters.</p>
<p>Among these is the hero&rsquo;s sister, who marries a German
attach&eacute; at the embassy in Washington; and another sister,
who marries a young man of the same social set&mdash;and things
happen. There is a drunken scalawag of a relative&mdash;who might
be worse, and there are one or two other people whom readers of
Mrs. Watts&rsquo; books have met before. The dates of the story are
from 1911 to the present year.</p>
<hr />
<h4><em>H. G. WELLS&rsquo; NEW NOVEL</em></h4>
<h3>Joan and Peter</h3>
<p class="rgt"><em>Cloth, 12mo, $1.75</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Never has Mr. Wells spread for such a gorgeous panorama
&hellip; a living story &hellip; a vivacious narrative
imperturbable in interest on every page, always fresh and personal
and assured&hellip;. This is not a novel&mdash;it is a library. It
is everything that one needs to know about the public life of the
significant classes in England for last twenty-five
years.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>The Dial</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Wells, at his highest point of attainment&hellip;. An
absorbingly interesting book &hellip; consummate artistry &hellip;
here is Wells, the story teller, the master of
narrative.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>N.Y. Evening Sun</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h4><em>A NEW NOVEL BY WILLIAM ALLEN WHITE</em></h4>
<h3>In the Heart of a Fool</h3>
<p class="rgt"><em>Cloth, 12mo, $1.60</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;A big novel&mdash;a book that will profoundly affect the
thoughts and the feelings of the many who will read it&hellip;.
Behind this chronicle lies the secret of the next fifty years of
American history. The fruit of this book will be an awakening of
the sleeping consciences in many men and a glimpse of what it is to
live in America to-day.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>N.Y. Sun</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great work. In its scope it is one of the most
comprehensive American romances ever written&hellip;. An intensely
dramatic story&hellip;. We have seen no truer nor more vital
portraiture of distinctive and important American
types.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>N.Y. Tribune</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Our House</h3>
<p class="cen">BY HENRY S. CANBY</p>
<p class="rgt"><em>Cloth, 12mo.</em></p>
<p>Mr. Canby, known as a teacher of literature and critic, also as
a writer of books on literary subjects, has written a novel, and
one of singular appeal. Its central character is a young man facing
the world, taking himself perhaps over-seriously, but genuinely
perplexed as to what to do with himself. Coming back from college
to a sleepy city on the borders of the South, his problem is,
whether he shall subside into local business affairs, keep up the
home which his father has struggled to maintain, or whether he
shall follow his instinct and try to do something worth while in
literature. This problem is made intensely practical through the
death of his father. The story of what the young man does is
exceedingly interesting. It takes the hero to New York and into the
semi-artificial life of young Bohemia and ultimately brings him
back home, where he finds the real happiness and success.</p>
<hr />
<h3>All the Brothers Were Valiant</h3>
<p class="cen">BY BEN AMES WILLIAMS</p>
<p class="rgt"><em>Cloth, 12mo.</em></p>
<p>This is a stirring story of the sea somewhat suggestive in
manner of Jack London&rsquo;s work. It has to do with two brothers
of a sea-going family who go on a cruise with the hope of
ultimately finding their older brother, Mark, who was lost on his
last voyage. The adventures which they have on a mid-sea island,
where Mark, pagan, pirate, pearl-hunter, is found, are absorbing.
Hidden treasure, mutinies, tropic love, all these are here. The
book thrills with its incident and arouses admiration for its
splendid character portrayal.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Flaming Crucible: The faith of the Fighting Men</h3>
<p class="cen">BY ANDRE FRIBOURG</p>
<p class="rgt"><em>Cloth, 12mo, $1.50</em></p>
<p>Under the title <em>Croire</em>, this autobiography of a French
infantryman was published in Paris in 1917. It is a revelation of
the French spirit. It is rather a biography of the spirit, than an
account of the amazing experiences M. Fribourg encountered, from
1911 at Agadir, through the fighting on the Meuse, and part of the
campaign in Flanders. The descriptions are memorable for their
beautiful style, their pathos or their elevation. There is a
definite climax toward the end where M. Fribourg returns to a
hospital in Paris, broken and dulled, his faith momentarily
befogged. Gradually he readapts himself, regains and confirms his
faith in the human spirit that was so vivid when he lived with his
fellow soldiers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An autobiographical novel, which was a close competitor
for the last Goncourt Academy Prize and which was seriously
considered in connection with the recently awarded Grand Prix of
the French Academy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It emphasizes the benumbing monotony of the &lsquo;life
in a circle&rsquo; of billet and trench.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It portrays realistically, if a shade too methodically at
times, the racking torments of hunger and thirst, the dreary
importunity of the rain, the loathsomeness of the all-invading mud,
the sickening horror of the carrion smells, the pathetically
inadequate relaxations of the cantonments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It dissects (a shade too scientifically and
cold-bloodedly at times perhaps) the sentiments and emotions
associated with attack and defence; the impulses that eventuate in
heroism; the alternating super-sensitiveness and callousness of the
nerves; fear and the mastery of fear; the &lsquo;hope deferred that
maketh the heart sick&rsquo;; the devious stratagems of the
terrible &lsquo;cafard&rsquo; (blues).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It narrates dramatically the outstanding episodes; the
perilous corv&eacute;e of bringing up fresh supplies of cartridges,
the digging of an advance trench under fire, the pinioning of a
comrade suddenly seized with dementia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this, with sanity, simplicity, and sincerity and in a
language of almost classical restraint, as a rule, but engagingly
piquant and picturesque and fantastic even upon
occasions.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Boston Evening Transcript</em>.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
